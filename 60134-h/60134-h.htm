  <h2 class='c004'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In presenting “Lumber Legal Opinions” to our members and to
some of our friends whom we particularly desire to become members
of our Association, not only for the good their co-operation will
do us, but for their own benefit as well, we desire to say that this
compilation is based upon the practical working out of specific cases
for our members during the past few years. An examination will,
we think, prove the work to be practical and dependable, and generally
to express good common sense, and consequently good law.
You will, we hope, find it worth your careful study and guidance.
In some instances the opinions may be affected by court decisions
of the respective States; some of these decisions are specifically
referred to, but, as a rule, it has been our aim to secure opinions
covering a general situation.</p>

<p class='c009'>This gives us an opportunity to remind you of the special
work which this Association is constantly undertaking for its members
and especially that it is worthy of your earnest co-operation
and special effort to bring in new members, so that the influence
of the organization may be enlarged and made in every way
worthy of its name.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<div class='sidenote'>Purpose of the Association</div>

<p class='c009'>The Charter defines the Purpose of the Association to be “to
protect the members against unbusinesslike methods in the wholesale
and retail trade; to foster such trade and commerce;
to reform abuses in such trade or business;
to secure freedom from unjust or unlawful
exactions; to diffuse accurate information among
its members as to the standing of merchants and
others by and with whom said trade or business is conducted, and
as to other matters to produce uniformity and certainty in the customs
and usages of said trade and of those engaged therein; to
settle differences between its members, and to promote a more
large and friendly intercourse between them.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Bureau of Information or Credit Department</div>

<p class='c009'>The Charter and By-Laws of the Association defines the duty of
this Bureau to be as follows: “To diffuse accurate information
as to the standing of merchants.” There are in the
records of this Bureau at the present time 28,000
reports showing the financial condition of an equal
number of buyers of lumber. In addition to these
financial statements all of these buyers of lumber
are rated by the Bureau as to their credit standing as well. It is
the unanimous opinion of our members who use this Bureau that
the reports are superior to those of any other mercantile agency
or other source of information. The Bureau makes a specialty of
securing reports only on lumber buyers or users, and it therefore
furnishes more complete and reliable reports as to moral and financial
standing and business methods than any other agency. A system
is also a part of the Bureau whereby important information is
sent to each subscriber without the subscriber making special request
therefor; in other words, it is the aim of the Bureau to keep its subscribers
fully and promptly advised of all important business
changes.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Legal and Collection Department</div>

<p class='c009'>In connection with and as a part of the Bureau of Information
there has been established a legal and collection department. This
department handles commercial claims, past due
accounts, etc., sent to it with promptness and at a
minimum cost when compared with the usual
methods employed by attorneys and the courts; also
has on file much information, including legal opinions
and court decisions which are furnished upon request without
charge.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Railroad and Transportation Bureau</div>

<p class='c009'>The Railroad and Transportation Committee through its Bureau
is in a position to be of the greatest service to our members, because
of the intimate knowledge which our Traffic Manager
has of all matters that have to do with our
relations with the railroads.</p>

<p class='c009'>Information and assistance covering a wide range
of transportation subjects is being constantly rendered.
There are also on file complete lumber tariffs which are
kept up to date, and this enables our members to obtain correct
information as to rates, routing, etc. Upon request, shipments are
traced and prompt deliveries effected. The above services are
furnished to our members entirely free of charge.</p>

<p class='c008'>This Bureau also investigates and collects claims for loss or
damage in transit, overcharges in rates, weight, mis-routing, etc.
For these services a nominal charge is made based on the actual
amount collected. The manager of this Bureau has had years of
experience and possesses intimate knowledge of the methods pursued
by the various claim departments of the railroads and he is
therefore in a position promptly to collect any just claims and frequently
has been able to collect claims which our members have been
unable to collect themselves. In this connection it may be well to
state that all shippers of lumber are entitled to free allowances in
weight of five hundred pounds for car stakes used on flat and gondola
cars, and this Bureau has secured many refunds on past shipments
for members who have not been allowed this free weight.
The Bureau is also in a position to compel the railroads not now
making the allowances, to do so.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Arbitration</div>

<p class='c009'>The By-Laws define the duties of the Arbitration Committee
to be “to settle differences between our members.” The services
of this committee are at the disposal of our members
at the actual cost of the expenses of three selected
men from among the members of this committee
who thoroughly understand the customs of the lumber
trade. Any member who avails himself of the services of this
committee consequently obtains at an actual cost the services of a
jury of experts, with the result that differences are settled fairly,
equitably and promptly and without any annoyances and undue
expenses.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Legislation Committee</div>

<p class='c009'>“To reform abuses” and “to secure freedom from unjust or
unlawful exactions” is jointly the work of several Committees.
For freedom from unjust and burdensome laws and
for laws granting us security and reasonable opportunity
in the conduct of our business, we look to
the Legislation Committee, whose duty it is to
scrutinize acts affecting the trade, to oppose those
which oppress, and to favor and forward those which assist.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Forestry and Conservation</div>

<p class='c009'>“To foster such trade and commerce” by perpetuating the raw
material which forms the basis of all lumber business, we have
our Forestry Committee. The people of this country,
with its tremendous sources of timber supply,
must be educated to grasp the possibility of a future
famine, and needful legislation must be enacted to
reduce the problem of reforestation to a practical
business proposition before the scarcity of timber shall enhance the
values of stumpage to the point of placing trees as a crop in the
same class with grain and cotton. The Advisory Forestry Committee
links our Association with the country at large in this movement.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Fire and Marine Insurance</div>

<p class='c009'>The services performed by the members of these committees
in past years have most fully justified their existence in the reduction
which has been obtained not only for our
members, but for all lumbermen both in fire insuring
companies as well as in marine insuring companies.
These savings amount annually to a sum which is
estimated at more than one million dollars in premiums.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Hardwood Inspection</div>

<p class='c009'>Our Association stands for not only a national but an international
set of rules to govern the grading and inspection of hardwood
lumber. In all lines of business nothing is
more desirable and necessary than uniformity. It
is the aim of the Hardwood Inspection Committee
to secure the adoption of a reasonable and universal
set of rules for the inspection of hardwood lumber.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Management</div>

<p class='c009'>The Active Management of the Association is in the hands of
a board of twenty-one trustees, operating with the
Officers and the Executive Committee, through the
Secretary and his assistants.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Headquarters</div>

<p class='c009'>The offices of the Association are at 66 Broadway, New York,
centrally located in the business section of the city.
Members have the unrestricted privilege of using
these offices as the headquarters for receiving mail
and telegrams, and for business conferences.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Membership</div>

<p class='c009'>The four hundred Lumbermen who are members are ready
and willing to testify to the advantages to be derived from connection
with this Association. Coming from 28 States
and Canada, they are qualified by numbers and
ability to cope with all questions affecting the manufacture
and wholesale distribution of lumber.</p>

<p class='c008'>Membership in our Association is restricted to legitimate manufacturers
of lumber and wholesale dealers in lumber who are in
good standing in the trade.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is no initiation fee. The annual dues are $50.00, with
a charge of $50.00 additional to those who desire the benefits of the
Bureau of Information. The Collection Department and Transportation
Bureau are open to all members without charge other
than the very moderate fees scheduled for actual work performed.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHOICE OF REMEDIES WHEN LUMBER IS REFUSED ON ARRIVAL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Recently a member took an order from a dealer in Pennsylvania
for a car of lumber, and after order had been forwarded to the
mill, the buyer requested that a change be made in a certain size
included in the order, which our member advised would be made
if shipment had not already gone forward from the mill. It developed,
however, that shipment had been made and that it was too
late to alter any part of the original order. Upon arrival the
buyer refused to accept the lumber on the ground that it was not
as ordered.</p>

<p class='c009'>In connection with this case we have the following opinion
from an experienced attorney:</p>

<p class='c013'>Seller has the choice of one of three things, viz.: First,
he may store or retain the property for the vendee and sue
him for the entire price. Second, he may sell the property,
acting as the agent for this purpose of the vendee, and recover
the difference between the contract price and the
price of resale. Third, he may keep the property as his own
and recover the difference between the market price at the
time and place of delivery and the contract price. Usually,
the best course to pursue would be to elect the second remedy,
to wit: that of acting as agent for buyer and dispose
of the carload of lumber and recover the difference between
the contract price and the price of resale. By proceeding
in this manner, they may have the use of the price realized
from the sale, and they have done all that good faith required
to the end that any loss sustained be reduced to a
minimum. Of course, the seller on the resale must dispose
of the goods in good faith and the best mode calculated to
produce their value, whether it be public auction or by
broker, or any other mode that can or could be easily adopted.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Opinion No. 1.</b></p>

<p class='c008'>A metropolitan dealer writes:</p>

<p class='c009'>We took an order in writing from a party for 25,000 feet of
lumber, 5,000 feet to be delivered the latter part of May, June,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>July, August, and until all should be taken. Buyer accepted the
delivery of the shipments until June, when he refused the shipment,
writing us a letter, as trade was dull, to please not ship any
more goods on account of order until he notified us. We immediately
wrote him that we should insist on his living up to the terms
of the contract. We had our truckman make note of the fact
that he tendered the goods at their factory and that they refused to
receive them. Now, can we sue and collect for these goods, and
in the future if they refuse to receive them after tendering them
can we sue? If we should instruct our truckman to leave these
goods on the sidewalk in front of their place of business, could
we sue, claiming this was a proper delivery and collect for same?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: When goods are to be delivered in a number of
instalments, as in this case, the buyer’s refusal to accept
delivery of any one instalment is a breach of the whole contract;
the seller may declare the contract at an end, from
that moment, and may sue and recover any damage that the
breach of contract may have caused him. The seller has the
choice of three remedies. He may keep the goods as his
own and sue for the damages; he may hold the goods as
agent of the buyer, informing the buyer that they will be
delivered to him upon his demand, and sue for the contract
price of the goods; or he may sell the goods, for account
of the buyer, giving the latter prior notice of the time and
place of sale and then hold the buyer for any deficiency.
A delivery of the goods upon the sidewalk in front of the
buyer’s place of business would be of no advantage to the
seller and it might make him liable for that part of the goods
if the buyer neglected to take charge of them. The seller
cannot sue for the price of each instalment, when it has been
tendered and refused. This would be to put the buyer to
the expense of defending a number of suits, all arising out
of one contract, and this the law does not sanction. Though
it calls for delivery at different times, the contract is one
and not several, and it may be made the basis of only one
action. Suit may be brought as soon as there is a breach
of it, it is true, but that suit must be for all the loss arising
by reason of the buyer’s unjustifiable act, not simply for the
value of the single instalment tendered and refused. When
any suit is brought the court will assume that it is for all
the loss arising out of the contract and further suits upon
the same cause of action will be barred.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>INTERPRETATION OF “F. O. B.” SHIPPING POINT OR DESTINATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>As there seem to be many opinions on the question of “ownership
in transit,” or delivery of lumber F. O. B., and as the association
has received numerous inquiries from members covering
various phases of the subject, the question has been submitted by
the association to Mr. Walter W. Ross, General Counsel to the Car
Stake and Equipment Complaint Executive Committee, and an experienced
railroad attorney, for opinion. While it must be conceded
that such an opinion can cover only a specific case, it will probably
be of value to many of our members when the question of ownership
in transit arises, and if followed, if adopted as a practical solution,
will help to bring about a better understanding between shipper
and buyer, always keeping in mind however, that the laws differ in
various States.</p>

<p class='c009'>His opinion is as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>If A sells lumber to B and the contract of sale provides
that A shall deliver the lumber free on board (F. O. B.)
cars at a certain point, the title to the lumber remains vested
in A, the seller, until he has delivered the lumber at the point
agreed upon to the buyer or his agent the carrier.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the lumber is damaged while in the possession of the
carrier in transit to the point of agreed delivery, the question
of the loss is between the seller A and the carrier. If
the lumber is damaged after delivery at the point agreed
upon, but while in possession of the carrier the question of
loss is between the buyer and the carrier.</p>

<p class='c013'>The question arises what constitutes delivery f. o. b.
In the case of shipment of lumber by rail it is customary for
the shipper to load the lumber properly on the car. It has
been held by some of the courts that it is not necessary for
the shipper having completed the loading to give formal
notice of delivery to the carrier in order to place the consignment
in the possession of the carrier—(but it is safer to
notify the carrier of such fact thereby eliminating a possible
controversy). If the sale is f. o. b. point of shipment the
delivery by the seller to the carrier is delivery to the buyer
and from that time the carrier until it has performed its
contract of transportation is the agent of the buyer. This
principle of law is subject to the exceptions arising under
the law of stoppage in transit, as for instance if the buyer
becomes insolvent after the shipment has been made—but
before arrival at destination.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>It has been held that the liability of the carrier begins
as soon as the consignment has been placed in its possession,
even though the bill of lading has not been issued.</p>

<p class='c013'>The question also arises when does the liability of carrier
as such terminate by delivery to the consignee.</p>

<p class='c013'>The general rule is that when the carrier has placed the
car of lumber on the track which is the usual and customary
place for the consignee to unload and consignee has had reasonable
opportunity to unload, then its liability as carrier
terminates and it is liable only as a warehouseman while the
consignment remains on such track, which means that the
carrier is required to exercise only the degree of care which
an ordinarily prudent person would exercise to protect his
property from loss or destruction. In some states the statutes
provide, or the courts hold, that the carrier having placed
the car in such position for unloading by the consignee, it
is then the duty of the carrier to send due notice of that fact
to the consignee; and until such notice and reasonable opportunity
has been given, the carrier’s liability as such continues.
In other states the carriers are not required either
by statute or rule of the courts to give such notice of arrival
of consignments, it being held to be the duty of the consignee
to keep himself informed as to the time of arrival of his
freight. This rule is gradually being superseded in most
states by the more reasonable rule that it is the duty of the
carrier to send due notice to consignee of arrival of freight.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>BUYING AND SELLING AGENT NEEDS NO LICENSE IN NEW YORK CITY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Very often out of town members who contemplate opening an
office in New York City, inquire as to whether it is necessary to
obtain a license in order that their agent may legally represent
them. The following appears to cover the ground:</p>

<p class='c009'>Question from Baltimore, Md.—I am acting here as a buying
and selling agent for a lumber company outside of the State, they
supplying me with the money with which to buy the lumber to ship
to them on their orders, and I crediting them with the proceeds of
the sales of lumber shipped to me to sell for their account, my
compensation being a commission on the sales and purchases.
Under these conditions I do not pay a license here in Baltimore,
but as I expect shortly to move the office to New York, I will thank
you to let me know if I would require a license to conduct this
business in that city, and if so, where should I apply for same?</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Reply: No license is required in New York City in
order to carry on such a business as our correspondent describes.
One who simply buys and sells here, as agent, need
not make a report or pay a fee to any public officer. But
if at any time he carries on a general mercantile business, as
agent, he must register and pay a fee. The statute is as
follows: “Any person now carrying on or conducting a
general mercantile or manufacturing business within this
State, or hereafter commencing such business at or in a fixed
location as agent or manager for another or others, shall—at
the commencement of such business, file a sworn statement,
verified by such agent and principal or principals, in
the county clerk’s office of the county within which said
business is carried on, stating the nature of the business
and the full name and residence of such principal or principals.”
The fee is $1.00, and failure to file the statement
is a misdemeanor.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>RETAINING LUMBER SHIPPED CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The acceptance of lumber, where the grade is disputed, is the
subject of the following correspondence:</p>

<p class='c009'>Question.—We recently shipped a car of lumber to a dealer,
who claims that same is not up to the grade bought. We have
asked him to return shipment and guaranteed to replace same with
material that was absolutely right. He refuses to do so, and states
that he will not return it until he receives lumber to replace the
lot he refused to accept. We have sold this car to another party,
who asks for delivery. We believe that the original purchaser is
making an unjust claim. Can we demand that the lumber be
shipped back to us, as the party has refused to accept same and
has not paid for it? In case he refuses to return it are we under
any obligation to make a second delivery?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: The purchaser in a case of this kind has no
right to any material that previously belonged to the seller
except under the contract which he has with the seller.
When the seller sends the purchaser any lumber and the
purchaser keeps it, he keeps it either wrongfully or else
as being in compliance with his contract. But the courts
will not allow any man to claim, for his own advantage, that
he is a wrong-doer when there is a possible and reasonable
explanation of his act which makes it lawful. For this reason,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>among others, a buyer of lumber when there has been
no warranty of quality, who retains the lumber sent to him,
and refuses to return it, is always held to retain it as being
perfectly satisfactory and in compliance with the contract.
Any complaint he may make about the delivery is of no
importance; it is his act that counts. The courts will insist
upon taking the most charitable view of his conduct, whatever
he may say, and the most charitable view is that he
is doing right, and not wrong, and is keeping the lumber
because it is a good delivery under the contract. Our correspondents
can demand that the lumber be returned if they
choose to do so, but they cannot enforce the demand. If the
buyer does return the lumber, in answer to such a demand,
he will have a claim against the sellers for another delivery,
and a valid one under the contract, or for a breach of the
contract in failing to make a good delivery in the first place.
If no such demand is made, or if it is made and not complied
with, the buyer can be compelled to pay the contract price
of the goods on the theory that his holding them is an acceptance
under the contract. It is idle for him to say that he
does not accept them; keeping them is acceptance. No second
delivery need be made unless the first delivery is promptly
and properly refused and returned.</p>

is to ascertain whether the corporation is transacting its business
in a manner which could be interpreted as “doing business” in its
legal sense, and this means generally filling all orders obtained
in that State when more than two or three incidental orders have
been obtained or the maintaining of a place of business in such
State. The difficulties in obtaining the certificates are not great
but the details are technical and the expense ranges from $10 upwards,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>depending upon the laws under which the company is incorporated,
there being retaliatory laws in some States. The average
expense is about $25, and the certificates are generally good for an
indefinite period; the only annual requirements being a formal
report which does not involve the giving of the details of the corporation’s
business and there is no annual taxation unless the corporation
has both property and is doing business within such State.</p>

<p class='c009'>In many cases where valid claims exist in favor of a corporation
of another State against a New York debtor, a serious obstacle
arises where the foreign corporation has not obtained a certificate
to do business in this State, and, therefore, cannot maintain the
action. By the statutes as last amended this prohibition covers also
any one to whom such foreign corporation has assigned the claim
for collection. The provisions of the New York corporation law
in this matter are easily complied with. There has to be a sworn
copy of the charter of such foreign corporation and the designation
of some person on whom process can be served.</p>

<p class='c009'>The objection to complying with the statute in this respect is
the possible liability to taxation after the corporation gets its name
on the State Register. All that is taxable in New York State is
the amount of capital used in the State, and this would be so small
as to be unimportant provided, of course, that the proper returns
to the tax departments at Albany and New York are made out each
year. This, we understand can be done in ordinary cases, at a
charge of $10, for the two reports, one to Albany and one to New
York, and this sum is a very small tax to pay for what must be
the advantages of selling lumber and maintaining the legal rights
connected with such sales in New York State.</p>

<p class='c008'>Question.—My shipper consigns me a car of lumber and marks
the bill of lading “via P. R. R. delivery.” If this car arrives by
the C. R. R. of N. J., can I be compelled to accept same from
them, or does my original contract entitle me to insist on P. R. R.

<p class='c013'>Reply: One of the important and imperative duties of
a carrier is to deliver the lumber as he is directed to deliver
it. A direction to deliver it to a specified connecting carrier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>or delivery concern cannot be fulfilled by delivering it
to another, any more than a direction to deliver it to a certain
consignee can be carried out by delivery to another
individual. If the carrier makes a wrong delivery, as here
described, he is guilty of conversion. The consignee is not
bound to accept the lumber from the connecting carrier to
whom it has been wrongly delivered. He may sue the original
carrier for the value of the lumber as soon as he learns
that a different delivery from that directed by the bill of
lading has been made.</p>

<p class='c008'>Question.—Some time in March last we received an order for
two cars of 32–inch lath. A few days after the order came to hand
we received a letter from our customer requesting us to defer shipment
on account of the threatened strike in the coal regions, which
request was complied with. The difficulties between the miners
and operators have of course been adjusted and operations were
resumed some time ago, but our customer has so far failed to furnish
shipping directions for the lath, which we had cut especially
for his order and piled on our docks ready for shipment at the time
his request was received to hold the order. Would we not be justified
in loading this stock up and putting cars in transit in accordance
with the original order and insisting upon acceptance of same
upon arrival?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: This buyer has not, in our opinion, lost his right
to select the route by which the goods shall be shipped to him.
There is no question that his delay in giving such instructions
has been unusually great, but the sellers on their part
have given no indication of an objection to such delay. It
is clearly their right now to demand that he send shipping
instructions immediately and to inform him that they will
send the goods by a route of their own selection if he does
not name a route by return mail; then, if the buyer does not
reply, or if he refuses to issue shipping instructions, or undertakes
to repudiate the contract, the sellers will have a choice
of three remedies: They may ship the goods to him by any
suitable carrier and compel him to pay for them; they may
inform him that the goods are held subject to his order, to
be shipped in whatever manner and at whatever time he may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>select, and then compel him to pay for them, or they may
name a time and place at which the goods will be sold at
auction for his account, giving him sufficient opportunity to
be present at the sale, and may then sell them at such time
and place, holding him liable for the necessary expenses of
advertisement and sale and for any amount, by which the
selling price may be less than the contract price.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Question.—One of our customers recently sent us a check for
less than the amount of his bill, saying in his letter that he was
remitting the full amount due us. If he had taken advantage of
the regular discount on his last purchase (which he did not do)
the amount now due us would have been within a few dollars of
the size of the check, but even then the check would not represent
the exact amount due to us. He does not say in so many words
that he is claiming a discount, just sends the check and writes,
“enclosed please find amount of my bill to date.” Something of
this kind happens rather frequently, and we would like you to advise
us whether we must forego using that check until we can
write and straighten out the matter with him. More is due to us
than he has paid us, and it seems a hardship that we should be
kept out of even this part of our claim during the week or month
which it may take to have a full understanding with our customer.</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: The creditor, in a case of this kind, is justified
in cashing the check and still demanding the amount yet due;
this amount he can recover by suit if it is not paid voluntarily.
The buyer, it seems, was not entitled to a discount, and he
has not made a specific claim to any. Being indebted to a
certain amount he simply sends a check for part of that
amount. He does not say that he claims a discount. If this
check for less than the full amount due had been accompanied
by a demand that it be either accepted as payment in
full, or else returned, a different question might have arisen;
but even then the check might safely have been cashed under
the facts of this case. This case is simply that of a man who
owes $100 and who sends his creditor a smaller amount. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>proper course for the creditor is to accept what is sent as a
payment upon account and still maintain his claim for what

<p class='c009'>Question from New Jersey.—A person wishes to start a lumber

<p class='c013'>Reply: In New York no person is now allowed to establish
a business under any name, corporate or individual,
except his own name, until he has first placed on record in
the county clerk’s office, in the county in which the business
is to be carried on, a statement of the facts. So far as

doing business as our correspondent proposes, and there is no
common law rule against it. If any creditor supposes that
the business is being carried on by a corporation he will not
be harmed by the mistake, because the liability of an individual

of a corporation. A creditor who learns that his business

<p class='c013'>Reply: If lumber is sold with an understanding that the

to ownership during transit, whether freight is prepaid and

and left for the buyer to pay. A seller is not bound to carry

  <h2 class='c004'>OBTAINING CERTIFICATES PERMITTING FOREIGN CORPORATIONS TO DO BUSINESS IN PENNSYLVANIA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A recent attorney’s opinion contained some valuable information
regarding the filing of certificates in New York State, permitting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>foreign corporations to transact business in that State and
maintain an action. We have been asked for information regarding
the requirements of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in this
matter and our attorney at Philadelphia, William S. Furst, Stephen
Girard Building, has forwarded the following opinion.</p>

<p class='c011'>Herewith follows an opinion embodying the essential points in
re foreign corporations doing business in the State of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Act of Assembly approved April 22, 1874, provides that
no foreign corporation (this includes corporations created by other
States) shall do any business in this Commonwealth until such corporation
shall have established an office and appointed an agent
for the transaction of its business therein, and it shall not be lawful
for any such corporation to do any business in this Commonwealth
until it shall have filed in the office of the Secretary of the
Commonwealth a statement under seal of such corporation, and
signed by the President or Secretary thereof, showing the title and
object of said corporation and the name of its authorized agent,
with a penalty attached thereto for violation, that a person shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor, etc.</p>

<p class='c011'>The words “doing business” do not include a sale in a foreign
State, although the goods are delivered in this State, or taking
orders, or making sales by salesmen through agents going into
Pennsylvania from another for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c011'>In short, a foreign corporation engaged in strictly interstate
commerce, may advertise its goods, send agents to solicit orders,
take orders, make contracts of sale respecting the same, and ship
them to customers in Pennsylvania, without violating the act, and
may sue to recover the price of any merchandise without filing the
statement required by the act, although the foreign corporation in
question has no office or place of business in Pennsylvania and no
part of its capital invested here.</p>

<p class='c011'>A foreign corporation, which has not complied with the Act above
stated, but has an office or place of business in Pennsylvania, or
any of its capital invested within the State, cannot enforce contract
rights in the courts of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class='c011'>It has been recently decided by the Supreme Court of the State
of Pennsylvania (the court of last resort) that a foreign corporation
which invests most of its capital in the State of Pennsylvania
for a period of six months while constructing a railway,
employs large numbers of men, but does not file a statement in the
office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, as required by the
provisions of the Act until two months after completion of the
work, cannot recover for labor and materials furnished in doing
such work.</p>

<p class='c011'>With respect to the taxes imposed upon foreign corporations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>doing business in the State of Pennsylvania, the Act of May 8th,
1901, provides that all foreign corporations shall pay to the State
Treasurer for the use of the Commonwealth a bonus of one-third
of one per centum upon the amount of their capital actually employed
or to be employed wholly within the State, and a like bonus
upon each subsequent increase of capital so employed. This is not
an annual tax. It has been defined to be the price paid the Commonwealth
for the privilege conferred on such corporation by its charter.
It is therefore in no sense a tax, and the payment thereof
does not relieve any corporation from any tax to which it is otherwise
subject.</p>

<p class='c011'>Respecting the taxation of foreign corporations, they are taxable
like domestic corporations on so much of their capital stock
as is invested within the Commonwealth under the provisions of the
Act of Assembly approved June 8th, 1898. The tax is imposed
annually at the rate of five mills upon each dollar of the actual
value of the whole capital stock of all kinds invested or represented
by capital invested within the State.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tax is settled by the accounting officers upon the basis of a
report required to be made by all companies subject to the tax, and
particularly upon the appraisement of the value of the stock contained
in such report. The report is filed between the first and fifteenth
of November in each year.</p>

<p class='c011'>Foreign corporations are also obliged to file a bonus report annually,
from which should appear whether there has been any
increase in the amount of the capital actually invested within the
State, so that the proper bonus charges may be made upon any
such increase as above stated.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>PAYMENT OF CLAIMS BY AN EXECUTOR—TIME FOR FINAL ACCOUNTING.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Occasionally the question arises as to what length of time an
executor has to close an estate, and the following, particularly the
second section, may be helpful:</p>

<p class='c009'>Question—Can an executor pay a bill of $10 or less, or what is
the largest amount he can pay, without having the claim verified
before a notary, according to law?</p>

<p class='c009'>2.—Within what time do the laws require that an executor’s
accounts shall be made up and ready for final settlement?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: 1. The law makes no distinction as to the
amount of the claim against the estate for which an executor
should require vouchers and an affidavit. The statutory provision
is as follows: “The executor or administrator may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>require satisfactory vouchers in support of any claim presented,
and the affidavit of the claimant that the claim is justly
due, that no payments have been made thereon, and that there
are no offsets against the same to the knowledge of the claimant,”
see Code of Civil Procedure, Section 2718. If an executor
should pay a claim of any considerable size, without this
precaution, and the claim should afterwards turn out to be
unjust, he could be, or probably would be, required to repay
the amount to the estate.</p>

<p class='c013'>2. The laws of this State do not fix any definite time as
the limit within which an executor must make his final accounting.
Whenever a year has expired since the grant of
his letters, the surrogate may compel the executor to make
an accounting of all that has been done up to that time. If
the estate is then in a condition to be definitely settled this
may be done. If there has been any remissness on the part
of the executor this may properly be dealt with by the surrogate.
If the executor has used due diligence, and still is not
ready to make a final accounting, he may have further time,
always, of course, under the supervision of the court.</p>

<p class='c008'>Question—A company in Boston sells to A in New York 800,000
feet of lumber and on the sales slip are the words, “for delivery, one
cargo in June, and one in July.” The lumber was shipped in four
cargoes, about 200,000 feet in each. The first two were shipped
in July; the third cargo on the 18th of August, and the fourth on
the 21st of August. The first two cargoes were accepted at the
contract price, $27, but the customer refuses the third and fourth
cargoes, claiming that we were late on the deliveries. It is a well
known fact that all through this year vessels have been very hard
to obtain. Has the New York dealer a right to refuse to accept the
third and fourth cargoes at the contract price? The price has
dropped from the spring to the present time from $27 to say $24.
The customer claims the last two cargoes at the going market price
prevailing at the time they arrived. Inasmuch as the cargoes cannot
be sold over again, except at a less price than the New York customer
offered, we were obliged to let him unload the last two cargoes.
We claim that the customer has no right to deduct anything,
owing to the lateness of delivery, because our orders read, “subject
to delays caused by fires, strikes or other causes beyond our control.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Reply: We suppose the clause quoted by our correspondent,
“subject to delays,” etc., is incorporated in the contract
or is so prominently printed on the order blank that
the buyer cannot fail to understand that the sale is made
subject to it. If that is true, and if it is also true that the
delay in this case actually arose from a cause beyond the
control of the sellers, then the buyer’s position was not tenable
at the beginning. It is possible, however, that the buyer
can maintain his position now by reason of the acquiescence
of the sellers. The buyer had a right to ask that a deduction
in the price be made by reason of the delay. If the sellers
had refused this request and demanded expressly that the
cargo be accepted at the contract price, or not accepted at all,
they could have enforced their demand. It does not appear
very clearly what answer the sellers made to the buyer’s
request for a lower price. Our correspondent says: “Inasmuch
as the cargoes cannot be sold over again, except at a
less price than the New York customer offered, we were
obliged to let him unload the last two cargoes.” There was
plainly a dispute as to whether the delay was one which was
excusable under the terms of the contract, and, if the act
of the sellers, or their answer to the request of the buyer
for a lower price, can be construed into an acquiescence in
that request, the sellers are now bound by such acquiescence.
If the sellers have always insisted that the contract price
must be paid, that the goods must be accepted in strict accordance
with the contract, or rejected, then they are in position
to collect the full contract price for all the lumber.</p>

is shipped as per contract, and the consignee pays a sight draft with

of insisting on having the shipment replaced or canceling the order?</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Reply: Our correspondent calls attention to the fact
that the contract in this case called for a delivery of the lumber
at the end of transportation. This being so, the seller
was bound to carry and deliver the lumber, as well as to
furnish it. The carrier was an agent of the seller and if the
lumber is not delivered the seller is to look to the carrier for
damages, while the buyer looks to the seller. What the
seller undertook to do in this case was to supply the lumber,
to carry it, and then to deliver it. If he fails in either point
he is guilty of a breach of contract. He has failed to deliver
the lumber; the buyer may regard this as a breach of contract,
which it is, and sue for such damages as may have
come upon him as a result of the breach. The buyer cannot
compel the seller to replace this lumber with other; but if
the seller would rather do that than pay damages, and if the
buyer is willing to have it done, then, of course, it may be

<p class='c013'>Reply: We do not find any statute or decision in Rhode
Island to the effect that a payment of this kind constitutes
payment in full. All the reported decisions by the courts of
that State we have been able to find lay down practically the
same rules upon the subject that are enforced by the courts
of New York. This payment was made in New York, and
the laws of this State govern it in any event. The law upon
the subject here (and, so far as we can learn, in Rhode
Island, too), is briefly this: If there is no doubt, and no
dispute, as to the amount due, then payment of less than
that amount will not discharge the debt, even though the
creditor agree to accept it as a discharge, if there is no release
under seal and no new consideration given. If the debt is
unliquidated, if there is a doubt or dispute as to the amount
of it, then the debtor’s offer of so much as payment in full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>constitutes his estimate of the amount really due. The creditor
cannot accept the money without accepting the estimate.
The debtor has a right to go into court to have the dispute
settled, and if the creditor is unwilling to accept the condition
under which the money is sent he is bound to return
the remittance and allow the whole matter to be determined in
some authoritative way. For decisions to the effect that part
payment of a debt that is liquidated and certain is not payment
in full, even when the creditor accepts the money and
uses it, see 23 N. Y., 684; 108 N. Y., 470; 1 R. I., 496;

  <h2 class='c004'>PRIVILEGE OF STOPPING LUMBER IN TRANSIT WHEN BUYERS BECOME INSOLVENT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Question—When lumber has been sold and shipped, and the
seller afterwards directs the carrier not to deliver it to the buyer
but to return it to him, is the carrier under any obligation to return
it, or must he go ahead and deliver it to the buyer, or may he exercise
his own will in matter? What are the legal rights of all parties
in such a case?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: If one who has sold lumber on credit learns,
after it has been delivered to the carrier, that the buyer
is insolvent it is his right to demand that the lumber be not
delivered to the buyer, but be returned to him. This is known
as the right of stoppage in transit, and it is founded upon
the theory that one who buys on credit is bound by an implied
contract to keep his credit good until the date of payment
arrives. In order that the seller may be entitled to
exercise this right the buyer must be actually insolvent, that
is, unable to meet his just obligations as they fall due; the
lumber must be still in the hands of the carrier, and not yet
delivered into the actual or constructive possession of the
buyer. If the lumber is represented by a bill of lading making
it deliverable to the buyer or his order that must be still
under the buyer’s control; if he has transferred it to a third
person, who has taken it for value and in good faith, the
seller’s right of stoppage is gone. If a seller who has a right
to stop the lumber attempts to exercise the right by directing
the carrier not to deliver it the carrier is bound to obey the
direction. The carrier, however, acts at his peril in any case.
If he obeys the instruction and refuses to deliver the lumber
to the buyer, and the buyer is solvent, he may bring an action
of trover against the carrier immediately. On the other
hand, if the carrier disobeys the instruction, and delivers up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>the lumber, he makes himself liable to the seller, at least to
the extent of the buyer’s indebtedness for the lumber, if
it is a case in which the seller is justified in exercising his
right of stoppage in transit. Because of these difficulties of

  <h2 class='c004'>SALES FOR FUTURE DELIVERY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Frequently the question of credit arises after a contract for
future delivery has been made, and the following may be helpful:</p>

<p class='c009'>Question—Will you kindly give us your opinion in the following
matter: A makes a sale to B of a certain quantity of lumber for
future delivery, payments to be made on a credit of sixty days’
time. Before the delivery of lumber begins, A has reason to believe
that the responsibility of B is not satisfactory to him and
refuses to ship the lumber except for cash with discount for the
difference in time. What redress has B in this matter, if he is not
in a position to pay cash?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: The refusal of A to ship the lumber to B under
these circumstances constitutes a breach of contract, for B
has an action against A for damages. Something more than
dissatisfaction with B’s financial responsibility is necessary
to furnish A with a valid excuse for his refusal to ship
except for cash.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>IN MOST STATES A CONSIGNEE MUST BE NOTIFIED OF THE ARRIVAL OF HIS LUMBER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Question—Is a railroad company obliged to notify the consignee
of the arrival of lumber when it is billed and the bill of
lading reads: “Order of shipper, notify consignee,” and if the
carriers fail to notify the consignee, have they the right to charge
demurrage or storage for the lumber so held? Would it make any
difference if the lumber were billed direct to the consignee and
were not an “Order notify shipment?” Have the courts made any
rulings of this matter, and where can we find them?</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Reply: A railroad company is, of course, bound to comply
with the undertaking set forth in its own bill of lading.
If it accepts goods to be carried and delivered under a bill
which expressly directs it to “notify the consignee” there is
no ground upon which it can escape its obligation actually to
notify the consignee except the impossibility of finding him
by the ordinary means. If the consignee can readily be found
the carrier has not fulfilled the task which it has expressly
and in definite terms undertaken to fulfill until it has found
him and notified him. It has no right to charge demurrage
or storage until such notification has been duly given. If
the consignee cannot be found by the exercise of reasonable
diligence then the attempt to find him will serve the carrier
as well as an actual notification. If the bill of lading does
not, in express terms, direct the carrier to notify the consignee
this duty still rests upon the carrier by common law
as it is interpreted in this State. In some States (Massachusetts,
for example) the carrier is not bound to notify the
consignee of the arrival of his goods unless the contract of
carriage expressly so directs. But in New York the courts
hold that this is one of the carrier’s duties, as carrier, without
any special stipulation regarding it. This is the rule, as
the courts of New York have announced it. “The rules as to
the delivery of goods at their place of destination by a carrier
that prevail in this State are as follows: If the consignee
be present upon the arrival of the goods, he must take them
without unreasonable delay. If he be not present, but live at
or in the vicinity of the place of delivery, the carrier must
notify him of the arrival of the goods, and then he has a
reasonable time to remove them. If he be absent, unknown,
or cannot be found, then the carrier can place the goods in
its freight house, and if the consignee does not call for them
in a reasonable time, its liability as a common carrier ceases.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A previous opinion contained some information regarding foreign
corporations obtaining certificates to do business in New York.
The following additional information, from our attorney in New
York, Mr. Eustace Conway, 15 William Street, regarding amendments
effective November 1st, will be interesting:</p>

<p class='c011'>There went into effect on November 1st, 1906, various important
amendments to the corporation Tax Law. The annual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>franchise tax is placed on a different basis from what it has been
heretofore for foreign corporations, and the license tax which foreign
corporations have to pay for doing business in this State is
also changed as to its method of determination. Under the new
law the measure of amount of capital stock employed in this State
(on which the tax of ⅛ of 1 per cent. is to be paid for this corporation
license to do business here) is to be such a proportion of
the issued capital stock as the gross assets employed in any business
within this State bear to the gross assets wherever employed
in business. As no action shall be maintained in any of the courts
of this State by such foreign corporation without obtaining a receipt
for this license fee, it is important to foreign corporations expecting
to do business here to comply with the statute and take out the
certificate. This tax, of course, is only to be paid once for the
license, unless later an increased amount of capital stock is employed
in the State, but this is not likely to occur. The annual franchise
tax is, of course, a different tax, but it is based on the same proportion,
except that the amount of dividends is also to be considered.</p>

<p class='c008'>Question—Please state whether or not, under the laws of the
State of New Jersey, a seller of building materials comes in under

<p class='c013'>Reply: Persons furnishing materials for the erection of
a building are called “material men” in the Mechanics’ Lien
Law of New Jersey, and they have a lien which is protected
like that of a laborer. The first section of the law provides
that “every building hereafter erected or built within this
State shall be liable for the payment of any debt contracted
and owing to any person for labor performed or materials
furnished for the erection and construction thereof, which
debt shall be a lien on such building, and on the land whereon
it stands.” It is further provided, in a later section, that
“whenever any master-workman or contractor shall, upon
demand, refuse to pay any person who may have furnished
materials used in the erection of any such house or other
building—it shall be the duty of such—material man to give

<p class='c008'>Question—A has sold to B a carload of lumber to be delivered
on or before November 24, payment cash promptly after arrival
and examination. The lumber arrives on the 24th, and A gives on
that day to B an examination order for the lumber, which examination
order B accepts. B uses proper diligence in trying to examine,
but, owing to congestion of cars at the depot the lumber is
not unloaded for several days, and he can only examine it on the
28th. He finds it to be of a quality inferior to the grade contracted
for and rejects it, and his rejection is sustained by arbitration.
B claims the right to go into the market on the 28th, buy a
carload of lumber of the grade contracted for and demand from
A the difference between the contract price and the price paid by
him on the 28th. A maintains that he can only be held responsible
for the difference between the contract price and the ruling market
value on November 24, the last date stipulated in the contract.
Who is right?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: This lumber was sold for delivery at the buyer’s
end of the route, the purchase price was to be paid only after
arrival and examination. The carrier was an agent of the
seller, and he did not give the buyer an opportunity to make
examination until November 28. No valid delivery was
made, or could have been made, before November 28, inasmuch
as an examination by the buyer was to precede such
delivery. When delivery was tendered on November 28 the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>lumber was found to be such as the buyer was at liberty to
reject. He was, accordingly, authorized to go into the market
on that day and buy at the price then prevailing in order

<p class='c013'>Reply: Until lumber shipped has been completely delivered

<p class='c008'>Question—On October 25th we bought of a manufacturer a
carload of lumber through their agent. On the 30th we received
confirmation of the order. Nothing was said about the time of
shipment, except that in sending the sizes on October 26th, we told
them to “ship at once.” On November 1st they wrote that they
would ship it “the coming week.” No part of it has been shipped
yet. We could have disposed of the carload during this time at a
very good profit. During all this time we have been completely out
of this kind of lumber. Have we a just claim for damages?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: It does not appear whether the confirmation
received by the buyers on October 30 was sent by the sellers
before or after their receipt of the instruction to “ship at
once.” The only importance of this point is this: If the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>sellers confirmed the order after receiving the instruction to
“ship at once,” they were bound to ship at once. If they
confirmed the order before receiving this instruction, then
the instruction formed no part of the contract, and is not
to be taken into account; in that case the sellers were bound
simply to ship the lumber within a reasonable time—within
the time within which these sizes commonly are shipped. If
they have not done so, they are guilty of a breach of contract
and the buyers may recover any damages the breach has
caused them. They are entitled to be placed by the sellers in
as good a position as they would be in if the sellers had carried
out their contract according to its terms. The letter of the
sellers of November 1, saying they would ship the goods “the
coming week,” forms no part of the contract. The agreement
was made before that letter was written, and it is binding
as originally made. The letter is of importance, however,
as showing an estimate of the sellers themselves as to what
was a reasonable date of shipment. The letter is not binding
upon the buyers, if they can prove that an earlier date would
have been reasonable; but it is binding upon the sellers, who

<p class='c013'>Reply: If your lumber was received by the company
and, without authorization from you they put it in the dry

they would be liable to you for the invoice price. They cannot

which can be ascertained upon an inspection of the lumber
upon arrival. They do not waive any defects that are what
we call “latent,” that is, that are not readily ascertainable

after the lumber may be put in use. As we take it, such
complaints as have been made relate to alleged defects which
they ascertained as soon as they received the lumber. In

<p class='c008'>Question—If I buy goods f. o. b. point of shipment and part
of the goods invoiced are lost in transit can the consignor enforce
payment for the goods not received?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: When goods are bought f. o. b. place of shipment
they are delivered to the buyer at the place of shipment.
Title to the goods passes to the buyer as soon as
delivery is made to the carrier and the carrier is an agent
of the buyer to bring his goods to him. If the goods are lost
on the way the buyer must pay for them, just as if they had
reached him; they have reached his agent and have been
delivered to him, and that is all the buyer can ask. When
goods are sold the presumption always is that the buyer is to
take charge of them in the place in which they are at the
time of the sale. There is no presumption that the seller
is to carry the goods to any place the buyer may select and
deliver them to the buyer there. The seller may do this, of
course, and he frequently does do it; but he is never bound
to do it unless he has expressly so agreed. If the buyer,
in any case, declared that the goods were to be brought to
him by the seller he must show some clause in the contract
that has this meaning; in the absence of such a clause the
buyer, either in person or through an agent, is to take possession
of the goods in the place they occupy at the time of
the sale. The words, “free on board,” are sufficient to prevent
the seller from making a good delivery while the goods
are in his own warehouse, as he otherwise might do. These
words place upon him the duty of taking the goods to the boat
or cars and meeting the expenses necessary actually to start
them on their way; but when this much is done the seller’s
whole duty is done. The goods then belong to the buyer
and have been delivered to him; that is all that is necessary
to raise an obligation on his part to pay for them.</p>

contract on a six months’ credit, the lumber to be ordered out as
fast as we saw fit. We have taken a little more than half and only
about two of the six months have expired. We order another
small shipment to be made. The seller replies that he will send this
car, but that he can make no more deliveries unless we are ready
to discount part, at least, of our bill. He says that he has already
extended credit to us as far as he feels justified in doing. He seems
to pay no attention to the contract, under which we were entitled
to order out all of the lumber at once, or in such shipments as
suited us, and were to have a credit upon the whole bill of six
months. Will he be sustained in the stand he has taken? If we
have a remedy please say what it is?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: When lumber has been sold and part of it delivered,
it is too late for either the buyer or the seller to alter
the contract without the consent of the other. If the sale is
upon credit, as in this case, the terms of credit are such as
have been agreed upon in the beginning. Either the buyer or
the seller may ask, of course, to have the terms changed before
all of the deliveries have been made, but if the other does
not agree to the change the contract must be performed as it
was made. It would be as reasonable for the buyer to refuse
to accept the remainder of the lumber unless the terms of
credit were made more favorable to him, as for the seller to
refuse to continue his deliveries as agreed unless his new proposal
as to credits were accepted. If the seller, in the case
our correspondents put, refuses to go on with the contract in
its original form, the buyers will have the same remedy they
would have had if no deliveries at all had been made. They
may go into the open market, when the time for delivery
arrives, buy lumber enough to finish out the contract, and then
hold the seller for such amount as they are compelled to pay
over and above that named in the contract. Or, if they do
not choose to do that, they may establish the amount of the
loss arising from the seller’s breach of contract in any way in
which it can be shown to the satisfaction of a jury and collect
the damages so established. Or the buyers may cancel the
remainder of the contract if they prefer that course. There
is only one exception to this rule. Any one who has bought
goods on credit is bound by an implied agreement to keep his
credit good, and if he fails to do so he cannot require the
seller to deliver the goods. Accordingly, if a buyer, before all
of the lumber is delivered, shows an inability to pay any just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>claim in the ordinary course of business, when it falls due,
those who have sold him on credit may lawfully refuse to
go on with the deliveries and the buyer will have no remedy.</p>

that is, on goods shipped from New York to New Orleans.</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: (1) When goods are sold f. o. b. place of shipment
the meaning is that the seller, for the amount named in
the contract, will supply the goods and will bear the expense
of delivering them on board that conveyance which is to carry
them to their destination. The only difference between the

the goods are to be delivered is that which is to take them to

February, March and April in equal monthly shipments. The first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>shipment has not been made in February and we would like to
know whether this entitles us legally to cancel the entire contract
or only the February lot. In other words, does the breaking of a
contract in one instance cancel the entire contract?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: When goods are to be delivered in instalments
the courts of this State hold that the seller’s failure to deliver
one instalment justified the buyer in refusing to accept that
tender and also in rescinding so much of the contract as is
yet unfulfilled. It is one contract, not several, and the seller
cannot insist on a right to deliver only such instalments as
he finds it convenient to deliver and to have them accepted.
The buyer has not agreed to pay anything at all for part of
the goods. His contract is that he will pay a certain amount
for all of them. If he is not to have all of them, it is quite
conceivable, and is often a fact that any part less than all is
of very much less than proportionate value to him; it may
have practically no value to him at all. In any event, the
seller has agreed to do a certain service and the buyer has
agreed to pay a certain sum of money. The court will not
infer from that an obligation to pay half the money for half
the service or to accept half the service on any condition, if
the other half is to be, or has been, withheld.</p>

<p class='c008'>Question—A customer places an order with the mill for November,
December, January and February, proportionate shipments.
The mills are unavoidably delayed in executing the order, but are
finally able to make shipment of practically the whole order in
February. The customer refuses to pay invoices for all the goods
shipped in February, but claims dating on proportionate amounts
in April, May and June. Is he justly or legally entitled to the dating
and could he hold the goods subject to sellers’ order?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: There seems to have been no clause in this contract
releasing the mill in case of such a delay as has occurred.
In the absence of such a clause the buyer was justified in
refusing to accept the goods when all of them were shipped
in February. He is entitled to hold the goods subject to the
seller’s order, or to return them. He cannot, however, force
another contract upon the seller than that which was actually
made. The mill may take back its goods or allow the buyer
to accept them upon such new terms as may be agreed upon.
The buyer is justified in receiving the original contract. This
is upon the supposition that the buyer has not during the
past four months said or done anything to lead the seller
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>to suppose that he was satisfied with the delay, that he would
accept all of the goods as readily in February as if shipment
had been made in strict accordance with the terms of sale. If
he has done that he is estopped now from making any objection
to the tender.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>AMOUNT OF CLAIM FOR DAMAGE AGAINST CARRIER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Question—We made a shipment via two connecting railroads.
When it reached a junction prior to delivery at destination, i. e.,
a point on the second road, was badly or entirely damaged in a
wreck, and our customer asked that we immediately replace the
shipment, which we did, and made another shipment of the same
kind of lumber four days later, but in the interim between the
time of the first shipment and the time we received the replacing
order from the customer, the price advanced, and in our second
invoice we naturally charged the customer for the advance. The
claim department of the railroad now offers to settle with us at
the original invoice price of the first shipment and declines to entertain
a settlement at the advanced price. We claim that our
position is entirely legal in the matter, and that we are entitled to
the advanced price for the shipment that was lost, the same representing
the value of the goods at the time the goods were destroyed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: Usually the measure of damages in a case of this
kind is based upon the value of the goods at the time and
place and in the condition in which they ought to have been
delivered; the freight is to be deducted from this, if it has
not been prepaid, and then interest is to be added from the
day on which delivery ought to have been made to the day
of payment; there is to be added also any expense to which
the owner of the goods has been put as a necessary and natural
result of the loss. What the carrier is bound to do is
to put the owner of the goods as nearly as possible in the
same position he would have occupied if the carrier had
done his full duty in the first place. If the carrier had done
his duty the owner could have sold the goods at the market
price on the day of delivery at the place of delivery, he would
have had the interest on the money thereafter, he would
have escaped all incidental expenses arising out of the loss,
and he would have been called upon to pay freight to the
carrier, if it had not been paid in advance. There is only one
exception to the rule that is at all common. If the goods
have already been sold for delivery at destination, at a price
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>less than that which chances to prevail when the day of delivery
arrives, and if the carrier, at the time of shipment, had
actual or constructive knowledge of this fact, then the owner
can demand only the selling price with interest. In that case,
if the carrier had done his duty, the owner would have
obtained for his goods, not the market price, but only the
contract price. Whether the carrier had or had not notice
of the sale makes a difference in this respect; that a carrier
is not to be held for a larger loss than he had in contemplation
when the freight rate was fixed and the degree of care
demanded of him was settled. If he had no knowledge of
the sale, actual or constructive, he is bound for damages
based upon the market price, as in the other case. The fact
that other goods at a different price were sent to replace the
lost shipment does not enter into the matter.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Question—We received a check from one of our customers and
sent it to the customer’s bank for certification. The bank failed before
the end of the next day and our check was not paid. Can
we not return it to the maker and demand the face of it from
him?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: If the drawer of the check in this case had sufficient
money on deposit to meet it our correspondents have
no other recourse except against the assets of the insolvent
bank; the depositor is discharged. The usual rule is that
when a check is delivered that is drawn upon a bank in the
same place in which the payee resides the drawer guarantees
the solvency of the bank during the remainder of the day on
which the check was delivered and the whole of the next day.
The holder has this much time in which to present the check
and draw the money; if the bank fails meanwhile the loss is
upon the drawer of the check and the holder takes the risk
of failure after the second day. But this rule does not apply
when the holder of the check takes it to the bank and has it
certified before the end of the next day after he receives it.
Certification binds the bank and releases the drawer. So far
as the drawer and holder are concerned, the effect is precisely
the same as if the holder had drawn the money and had then
deposited it to his own credit in the same bank.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Question—Lumber has been sold for delivery in installments
running through a considerable period. Payments are to be made
in installments also. The buyer has been very lax in this regard,
however; he has not made a single payment strictly on time, and in
some cases has delayed until the seller has been compelled to
threaten suit. Is the seller bound to go on making deliveries to the
end of the time named in the contract, getting his money whenever
and however the tardy buyer sees fit to pay it?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: If a seller agrees to deliver the goods at certain
times, and the buyer agrees to pay for them in installments
at given dates, each promise is a consideration for the other.
If either the buyer or the seller fails to do his full duty under
the contract he is in no position to demand that the other shall
do what he has agreed to do. In other words, as soon as
either is guilty of any breach of the contract the other may
declare the whole agreement at an end; he may refuse to do
anything further under the contract himself, and may demand
damages of the person who was guilty of the breach. If a
buyer fails to meet any payment promptly when it is due, the
seller, if he chooses to do so, may immediately rescind the
contract and bring suit for the unpaid installments and for
damages. If he had not this privilege he might be compelled
to go on for months delivering his goods to one who had
already shown his unwillingness or inability to make good his
promise of payment.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Question—When does the railway’s liability end and the consignee’s
begin on lumber delivered in cars on the consignee’s side-tracks;
i. e., if a carload was burned in forty-eight hours after being
placed for the consignee, would the loss fall on the transportation
company or the consignee?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: When a carload of merchandise is delivered upon
the consignee’s own side-track and the consignee has notice,
express or implied, of that fact, then all liability of the railroad
company for the safety of the merchandise ceases at
once. The goods are still in the company’s cars, but that is
not sufficient to make the company liable, for the cars themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>are in the custody of the consignee and upon his premises.
The goods have been delivered to the consignee, and
that is the last of the duties the carrier undertook to perform.
A railroad company cannot be expected, and in some cases
would not be allowed, to place its watchmen in private
freight yards and to extend over and through those yards its
system of protection against fire. When cars containing goods
have been delivered upon the consignee’s premises the goods
themselves have been delivered there. The carrier is no

to deliver this contract. A has the opportunity to buy the identical

after being notified by B that he does not care to deliver this contract.
Does the fact that A has the opportunity to cover himself
on the same conditions release B of damages arising from non-delivery
of the contract, or can A wait until the time of delivery
before buying goods in the open market against the contract of B
which the latter refuses to deliver?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: If B is under contract to deliver goods to A in
October, and if, before October, he notifies A that he does
not intend to fulfill his contract obligation, A may accept that
statement as final and protect himself at once. He may make
other arrangements for an October delivery and compel B
to pay the loss, if any, or he may sue at once for breach of
contract. The buyer is not bound to pursue this course, however.
He may act upon the supposition that, upon further
consideration of the matter, the seller will conclude to do his
duty after all; and so the buyer, A in this case, may wait
till the time arrives for the October delivery, and may then
buy goods to replace those that the seller ought to have delivered,
holding the seller liable for the loss, if any, or he
may then sue for breach of the contract. If this costs the
seller more than the other plan might have cost him, the

<p class='c008'>Question.—The following is a general form that is frequently
printed across the top of the letter heads of manufacturers: “All
agreements are contingent upon fires, strikes, delays of carriers,
accident and other contingencies beyond our control.” What effect
does this have on a contract when such letter heads are used when
quoting prices and when accepting the order?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: Any provision that is intending to form part of a
contract ought to be introduced into it in express terms or
else referred to so that there can be no mistake regarding it.
In the particular case under consideration the clause should be
incorporated in the contract or acceptance, or the contract
should state that the sale is made subject to the terms and
conditions printed across the top of the paper. Either one
of these would be a simple, easy procedure and would remove
all doubt. A contract usually begins with the name of the
place and a date, or with the names of the parties; and it
ends with one or more signatures. Both parties are bound
by all that lies within these limits and by everything beyond
that is referred to as forming part of the agreement; but
neither party is, as a rule, expected to look anywhere else—even
around the margins of the same paper—to ascertain
his rights and liabilities. It may be possible, in some cases,
to make a provision printed on the margin of the paper containing
the contract part of the contract itself, but there is
always more or less doubt upon this point, and no doubt
should be left where it is so easy to make the meaning plain.
If the marginal printing is to be useful at all it will be
mainly in connection with a statement that the contract was
made subject to a certain usage of the business, or a certain
custom of that particular house, and that this custom was
well known to the buyer; as proof of this fact the words
across the top of the paper would be useful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Question.—Inform us what recourse we would have against a
railroad for a shipment of lumber from Buffalo to New York,
which has already been on the road eighteen days, as shown by the
shipping documents, and has not arrived yet. In the meantime the
market dropped some 10 per cent. in price. This lumber was
bought f. o. b. Buffalo.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Reply: A carrier is bound, not only to deliver the lumber
entrusted to him for carriage, but to deliver it with reasonable
promptness. The courts recognize the fact that promptness
of delivery has an importance second only to the fact of
delivery itself. What is to be held as constituting reasonably
prompt delivery is to be decided in accordance with nature
of the goods and all the circumstances of the particular case;
it is such delivery as carriers of the kind in question, carriers
by rail or vessel, as the case may be, ordinarily make
in handling goods of the same kind as those in question.
When the time arrives for delivery to be made, under this
rule, and the goods are not delivered the consignee is entitled
to sue for their value at destination on the day on which
delivery ought to have been made. If the carrier is able to
deliver the goods, and offers to do so, at any time before he
has been required to pay for them as goods lost, the consignee
cannot refuse to accept them and still recover their full value.
He is bound to accept the goods whenever they are tendered,
no matter how great the delay may have been; but in such
a case he still has a valid claim for any loss he may have sustained
as a result of the delay. His damages are at least as
great as that amount by which the market value of the goods
on the day of delivery is below their market value on the day
on which delivery ought to have been made; to this is to be
added any other loss or expense brought upon him as a
direct result of the carrier’s delay.</p>

<p class='c008'>Question.—I purchased some lumber from a party in New York
State at a given figure f. o. b. shipping point, and had it forwarded
by the railroad company according to my instructions. Upon arrival
my customer reported to me a shortage of several hundred feet,
of which I in turn notified the party from whom I bought. He
stated that he hardly thought such a shortage was possible and
asked me to retally the lumber. I communicated with my customer,
who told me that the shortage reported was correct, and that
he had used up the lumber as he was in need of the lumber, although
I requested him to hold it intact. My customer in settling
with me deducted for the full amount of the shortage,
whereas the party who sold to me refuses to accept settlement on
this basis, offering me an affidavit from his shipper that the quantity
alleged to have been shipped by him was correct. Am I compelled
according to the New York court rulings to remunerate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>party who sold to me as per his invoice? He claims that the lumber
ceased to belong to him when he placed it at the railway company’s
depot subject to my instructions. For this reason he demands
full payment. I am in a position to furnish an affidavit
from the party to whom I sold the lumber to the effect that the
shortage actually occurred at destination, although the lumber was
received in good condition.</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: This lumber was sold f. o. b. shipping point and
it is true, as the seller says, that title passed to the buyer at
that point. This fact, however, does not excuse the seller
for delivering short count or tally, if he made such delivery.
He undertook to deliver a certain quantity of goods at the
shipping point, and his contract obligation was not fulfilled
unless he delivered that quantity. It does not appear, however,
that the contract was such as to allow the buyer to
accept less than the quantity sold at a pro rata price. As the
contract is described to us, it was a sale of a definite quantity
for a stipulated price, with no other provision. That being the
case, the buyer, when tender was made to him had no choice
other than to accept the tender as satisfactory, or else to
reject it and claim damages for breach of contract. He did
accept the goods and he used them. It is too late now for
him to say that the tender was in any respect unsatisfactory.
The buyer might have rejected the goods on account of short
tally, and then he could either have claimed damages for
breach of contract, as we have suggested, or he could have
communicated with the seller, offering to take the shipment
at less than the contract price—could have made a new contract,
in short. He did neither. He accepted the goods. He
will not be heard now to say that they were, in any respect,
not such goods as the contract called for. Our correspondent

price, and the person to whom he sold them can be compelled

<p class='c013'>Reply: Suppose A owes B a certain sum of money and
there is no doubt or dispute as to the amount actually due.
Then if A pays to B less than the amount, in cash or by check,
saying at the time, “this I tender as payment in full,” B may
keep the money or cash the check without losing the right he
previously had to demand what was still due and unpaid.
No man, without the consent of his creditor, can discharge the
whole of his debt by paying part of it, if the amount is
liquidated and certain. Suppose, however, that there has
been no agreement as to the amount due or that there is an
honest and well-founded dispute concerning the matter. Then
when the debtor sends any reasonable amount, with a statement
that it is tendered and is to be accepted, if at all, as
payment in full, that is his estimate of the sum due. The
creditor cannot accept the tender without accepting the estimate;
if he does accept the tender the amount due is thereby
agreed upon and fully paid. If the creditor is not willing to
accept the tender as payment in full he must return it. Then
an agreement may be reached as to the amount actually due,
or if the two cannot agree the matter may be left to the
courts. The debtor has this privilege, in a case of this kind,
because it would be unfair to him to allow the creditor to
keep what the debtor honestly believed to be the whole sum
due, and still allow him to sue for more, when, if he had
brought his suit in the first place it is possible he might not
have been able to recover even as much as the debtor has

</div>

<p class='c008'>Question.—Please advise us, what the position of a shipper is
who takes an order for a full carload of material at a price including
freight to destination, but where the shipper takes out a bill of
lading in the name of the buyer. The shipper claims he simply
guarantees freight to destination, and having the bill of lading
issued in the name of the buyer places the risk of loss or damage
in transit on the buyer.</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: A buyer of goods takes title to them wherever
they may be at the time of the sale unless the contract provides
otherwise or unless the seller by some act of his own
reserves the title to himself during transportation. A mere
agreement on the part of the seller to pay the freight is not
sufficient to rebut the presumption that title was to pass
on delivery to the carrier. When goods are sold
f. o. b. destination the seller undertakes to carry them to
their destination and there deliver them. They are his
goods, and the risk is his, until he has tendered
delivery at that place; this is true because the buyer cannot
be compelled to accept a tender made at any other place;
but a mere agreement that, for a given price, the seller will
furnish the goods and pay freight upon to a given place, does
not make him liable for their delivery in that place. If he
was bound to deliver them at destination the contract would
say nothing about freight; an obligation on the seller’s part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>to deliver the goods at destination is, in itself, an obligation
to pay freight upon them or to carry them himself, and it is
not for the buyer to choose which he shall do. If the agreement
to pay freight did place the risk on the seller during
transportation he could not escape that obligation by his own
act in taking out a bill of lading in a particular form. If he
was at liberty, under the contract, to deliver the goods at the
shipping point, however, he could increase his obligation by
his own act, and taking the bill of lading to his own order
would, if not otherwise explained be sufficient for this purpose.
In this case the bill of lading was taken in the name
of the buyer, and that is consistent with the seller’s claim that
a valid delivery could be and was made at the shipping point
and the carrier was an agent of the buyer.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Question.—Please advise us if in selling lumber freight paid
to destination we are liable for damage in transit. As we understand
it, when we sell lumber delivered at destination we are liable,
but when we sell it freight paid the buyer is liable.</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: The person who owns goods while they are in
transit must bear the expense of damage or loss if they are
not insured. If the goods have been sold the title during
transit may be either in the seller or the buyer. It is sometimes
perfectly clear that title is in one or the other, while
in some cases it is a very difficult question. Payment of
freight is one item to be taken into consideration, but it is
generally not alone absolutely conclusive of the question one
way or the other. Our correspondent is correct in saying:
“When we sell goods delivered at destination we are liable.”
It is equally correct to say: “When we sell them, otherwise
than for delivery at destination the buyer is liable.” It is
not always true, however, that the buyer is liable when the
seller pays the freight. Goods that had not been ordered, for
example, or goods slightly different from those ordered might
be sent in the expectation that the buyer would accept them.
In such a case the seller would probably prepay the freight
but title would remain in him, and the risk would be his,
until the buyer had received the goods and accepted them.
If the contract requires the seller to pay freight that is good
evidence, if there is nothing on the other side to offset it, that
title and risk are to be in the buyer during transit; this is so
because if the seller was bound to deliver the goods at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>buyer’s end of the route he would be bound to pay the
freight, as a part of this obligation, and would not separately
agree to pay the freight. If the contract is silent on that
subject the mere fact that the seller pays the freight is not
sufficient to show that he reserves title. All the facts of the
case are to be taken into consideration, the presumption being
that title passes when the goods are delivered, properly directed,
to the carrier. If the buyer claims that title did not
pass to him at that instant the burden of proof is on him, and
the mere fact that the seller paid the freight is not alone
sufficient to overcome the presumption.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>RAILROADS CAN INSIST ON ACCEPTANCE OF DELAYED SHIPMENTS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Question.—I shipped a carload of lumber to a customer consigned
to myself and it was apparently lost in transit. The delay
caused my customer to cancel this order with me, whereupon I
notified the railroad that I would not accept delivery and would hold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>it responsible for not only the value of the car, but any damages
resulting to me. The car has just turned up and the railroad insists
that I must take it and put in claim for loss. Am I compelled
to accept the car?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: If the road offers to deliver the lumber now the
consignee should accept it. A carrier is not a dealer, and
goods tendered by it cannot be refused, however late the tender
may be, or however seriously the goods may be damaged,
provided they are recognizable as the goods actually shipped
and have any value at all. The consignee cannot leave them
in the hands of the carrier and demand full value for them.
He must accept them and do the best he can with them. His
acceptance of them does not relieve the carrier of its liability,
and the consignee is entitled to recover all loss caused by
delay, or by damage to the goods, as soon as the loss has been
ascertained. If the market price has declined since the day
on which delivery should have been made that difference in
value is to be included in the damages; usually that is the
principal part of the loss, and frequently it is the whole of it.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>QUESTION OF DISCOUNT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Question.—I take an order from my customer, the terms of
payment being stated 2 per cent. 10 days. The buyer makes settlement
in 20 days and claims that he is entitled to the discount by
paying interest for the extra time which he has taken over and
above the ten days. On the other hand, I claim that the bill not
having been paid within the discount period becomes net, and that
face amount of the bill therefore becomes due on the eleventh day
Which is right?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: If a contract of sale gives the buyer no right to
a discount he has no such right. If the contract does give
him a right to a discount, upon certain terms, he must comply
absolutely with those terms in order to entitle himself to the
discount. The situation is just this: A seller who is entitled
to demand the full face of his bill, says to the buyer, “I will
deduct part of the amount if you will do a certain thing at a
certain time in a certain way.” The buyer cannot fail to do
the thing so specified at the time and in the manner named,
and still claim a discount as if he had done it. The buyer
is entitled to no discount at all in the case here put.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>LUMBER MAY BE RETURNED TO THE CONSIGNOR IF THE CONSIGNEE WILL NOT ACCEPT IT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Question.—We ordered a carload of lumber from a shipper in
the South and advanced $200 on account before the shipment arrived
at its destination. This shipper received from the railroad
company a bill of lading in his name marked “non-negotiable,”
which he indorses to us and mails to us and notifies the railroad by
letter that the shipment is for us. On arrival we find that the
lumber is not in accordance with our order and we refuse to accept
it, whereupon the railroad stores it for account of the owner. We
notified the railroad that we would release the car to the shipper
upon the latter paying to us the $200 advanced. The railroad has
since delivered the car back to the shipper on the latter’s instructions
by their giving the railroad the usual bond, which the railroad
insisted upon having, and we still retain the original bill of lading
indorsed to our order. We put in a claim against the railroad
company for the $200 advanced, taking the position that they had
no right to deliver the car to the shipper without the bill of lading
or an order from us. The railroad refuses to pay our claim, saying
that the bill of lading was a non-negotiable one, and inasmuch as
the shipper took it out in his own name he had a right to regain
possession of the car, and that we waived our rights, although
retaining the bill of lading, by refusing to accept the lumber on
arrival. We did not pay the freight. What course can we pursue
to recover the $200 advanced?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: If a consignee refuses to accept goods shipped
under a non-negotiable bill of lading they may be returned to
the consignor. The carrier is not bound to act as agent or
intermediary for the settlement of any differences between
the two. Here our correspondents have simply extended a
credit of $200 to the shipper. If he does not voluntarily
meet the obligation the amount may be recovered by suit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Question.—Should the railroad in settling claims for shortage
of lumber pay for it at our cost price or at the current market price?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: Unless the contract between the shipper and carrier
provides for some other measure of damages, the principal

lost or destroyed is the market value at destination. If the
freight has not been paid in advance it is to be deducted from
market value. There is to be added, on the other hand, interest
at the legal rate from the day on which delivery should
have been made to the day of settlement; and there is
to be added also any incidental expense to which the consignee
may have been put as a direct result of the carrier’s
failure to do his duty. This is the only way in which the
consignee can be placed in as favorable a position as he would
have occupied if the carrier had done his duty, the only way
in which the whole of the loss can be placed upon the carrier,

</div>

<p class='c008'>Question.—Have we a claim on the transportation company for
the invoice value of the shipment under the following conditions:
We made a shipment of a car of lumber, and when it arrived at
destination the railroad offered it to consignee and he refused it.
Some time later the railroad sold the lumber for what it would
bring, which, it appears, was only about 50 per cent. of our invoice.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Is the transportation company under obligation, in a case of this
kind, to notify the shipper that the lumber is at destination refused
and thereby give the shipper an opportunity to dispose of the lumber
without loss?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: If a carrier has no notice to the contrary, he is
entitled to assume that the consignee is owner of the lumber
and that any delivery or disposition of it of which the consignee
cannot complain will be satisfactory to all persons. If
the goods are sent C. O. D. or if the carrier is instructed not
to deliver them to the consignee until they are paid for, or
if he receives any instructions from which he may infer that
the consignor retains title to the goods, in any such case, it
becomes the carrier’s duty to inform the consignor of the consignee’s
refusal to accept the goods. The same result follows
if the carrier is expressly directed to give such notice and if
he accepts the goods under these directions. In any other case
the carrier is not bound to assume that the goods have been
sold and that the consignor is retaining title to them to secure
payment of the purchase price, or that the consignor has any
interest in them at all. He may assume that the consignee
has already paid for them, or that they were the property of
the consignee before shipment. The consignor has put it in
the power of the consignee to take the goods and do as he
pleases with them, and the carrier is bound merely to
act in such manner that the consignee may have no valid
ground of complaint. In the absence of special instructions
to the carrier, or of knowledge on his part that the goods
belong to the consignor, the rule is simply this: That the
carrier is not to be expected to deal with two different persons
with reference to a single shipment or the disposition
to be made of it; that he may safely assume such an understanding
between consignor and consignee that they will keep
each other informed, if necessary, and that anything that
satisfies the consignee will satisfy the consignor. There is
nothing in the question asked to show that it was the carrier’s
duty to notify the consignor in this case.</p>

<p class='c008'>Question.—A retailer goes away leaving his son in charge of
the business. The son asks us to ship a car of lumber and we sell
it to him, acting for his father, invoicing the car and mailing the
bill of lading. The car arrives, the son surrenders the bill of lading
to the railroad and orders the car placed on his father’s siding for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>unloading. For some reason the son decides not to unload the car
before the arrival of the father, which will be in about a week. When
the father arrives he claims the lumber is not up to grade and refuses
to accept same, unless we make an allowance. Does not the acceptance
of the bill of lading and its surrender to the railroad constitute
a delivery of the lumber and entitle us to our money without
question whether we are right or wrong about the quality of the
lumber? It is possible, of course, that a very small proportion
of this lumber may be a little off, but the difference is very slight,
and would show only the difference that any two inspectors would
make in going over the car of lumber.</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: A buyer of goods is bound to inspect them with
reasonable promptness, after he has an opportunity to do so,
and then accept or reject them at once. Reasonable promptness
is greater promptness than was shown in this case,
unless there were some unusual facts in connection with it of
which we are not informed. A buyer is seldom justified in
delaying his inspection beyond the next day after arrival of
the goods. If he does not reject the goods with reasonable
promptness, whether he sees fit to inspect them or not, then
he is held to an implied acceptance. They are placed in his
hands. He may do as he likes about examining them, but he
must reject them promptly, if he is to reject them at all. If
he does not reject them promptly any remedy he may have
had is gone unless the goods were sold to him under a warranty
of quality.</p>

New York State and its probable effect upon foreign corporations
doing business in this State, we have asked our attorney in New
York for information, and the following is submitted:</p>

<p class='c011'>“At the end of January last there was handed down a decision
in the Court of Appeals, which was later printed in 190 N. Y., settling
the disputes which had arisen as to the necessity for obtaining
certificates of license to do business in this State as a condition
precedent to suing here.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It holds that in compliance with the General Corporation Law
it must be alleged and proved by a foreign corporation in order to
establish a cause of action in the courts of this State. The cases
holding otherwise, should be regarded as overruled and the conflict
of authority ended.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“And it is further held that an objection to a complaint on
this ground is not waived by the failure to raise it in the defendant’s
pleadings, but can be raised at any time.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A little later the court also held that this rule applied just as
much as to the assignee of a foreign corporation’s claim, except as
to negotiable paper taken in good faith from the corporation before
maturity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It follows that any foreign corporation desiring to do business
in New York, whether on a large or small scale, must comply with
the statute and take out a license and pay the franchise at the end
of the first year, and I suggest that this should be brought to the
attention of your foreign lumber corporations.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>NEW JERSEY INCORPORATION LAW.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Question.—Under New Jersey laws a New York corporation
doing business in New Jersey must register in Trenton. We did
a large amount of business before we were aware of this, but ultimately
registered. In suing one of our customers we were nonsuited
because we were not registered at the time the goods were
sold, but this was in an inferior court. Does the fact that we were
not registered in Trenton at the time the goods were sold completely
shut us off from recovering in the State of New Jersey?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: We believe that our correspondents will not be
allowed to maintain this suit; they are prevented from maintaining
it as much by the laws of their own State of New
York as by those of New Jersey. The law of the case stands
thus: The New Jersey statute requires all foreign corporations
to file certain documents with the Secretary of State and
to take out a certificate authorizing them to do business in
New Jersey. It is further provided that “until such corporation
so transacting business in this State shall have obtained
said certificate of the Secretary of State, it shall not maintain
any action in this State, upon any contract made by it in this
State.” If this were all our correspondents could take out a
certificate any time and then sue; this section only forbids
them to sue before taking out a certificate. It is further provided,
however, that when another State imposes any greater
penalties on New Jersey corporations than the laws of New
Jersey impose upon corporations of that State, the same penalties
shall be imposed on corporations of such other State
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>doing business in New Jersey. Now, it is provided by the
General Corporation law of this State (Sec. 16) that foreign
corporations must take out certificates as in New Jersey, and
that “no foreign stock corporation doing business in this
State shall maintain any action in this State upon any contract
made by it in this State unless prior to the making of such
contract it shall have procured such certificates”; that is the
reason a New York corporation doing business in New Jersey
is not allowed to sue in the courts of that State on a contract
made therein unless it had taken out its certificate before
the contract was made.</p>

“Every agreement, promise or undertaking is void, unless
some note or memorandum thereof be in writing, and subscribed
by the party to be charged therewith, or by his lawful
agent, if such agreement, promise or undertaking—is a contract
for the sale of any goods, chattels or things in action

  <h2 class='c004'>A CUSTOMER BUYING ON CREDIT MUST KEEP HIS CREDIT GOOD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Question.—If a bill of lumber is sold on credit and before delivery
to the customer the seller considers he has good reason to
question the purchaser’s ability to settle when the bill is due, can
the seller withhold the delivery and demand either better terms or
cash without making him liable for the non-fulfillment of the
contract?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: A man who has bought goods on credit is
bound, as the courts phrase it, “to keep his credit good.”
If he does not do that the seller need not ship the goods;
if he has shipped them and then finds that the buyer has not
kept his credit good, he may stop the goods and take them
back into his own possession at any time before they have
actually been delivered to the buyer or his agent. In making
his decision the seller must, of course, take his own
risks. He has entered into a contract and he must fulfill
it or pay the resulting damages unless he has a legal excuse
for refusing to go on with it. It is not sufficient that, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>the question says, “the seller considers he has good reason
to question the purchaser’s ability to settle”; nor that the
seller has good grounds for believing that the buyer’s credit
is impaired. It is not a question of any man’s belief, but
a question of fact. The goods must be shipped unless the
buyer is actually insolvent. This does not mean that he
must have made an assignment or gone into bankruptcy or
made any other public acknowledgment of the fact that he is
insolvent. It means he has become unable to pay his debts
as they fall due. The seller must be able to show that at
least one debt has fallen due against the buyer and that he
has not paid it promptly. Of course, it must be a debt the
validity of which the buyer himself does not dispute upon
any tenable ground. If he has paid his debts as they fell
due he has “kept his credit good,” no matter what any one
may suspect as to the future; if he has failed to pay any
just debt promptly he has not kept his credit good. If the
seller has no right to refuse delivery of the goods altogether
he has no right to demand better terms than his contract
gives him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Question.—We sold to a concern and the terms of sale were
“2 per cent. discount for cash in ten days or sixty days net.” The
buyer in his settlements has taken fifteen to twenty days’ time and
has deducted 2 per cent. discount and has added 6 per cent. per
annum for the extra days beyond ten. We claim that this settlement
is entirely wrong, and if he wishes the discount in full he
must send a check within ten days after the date of the bill.</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: No debtor is to be excused from paying the full
amount of his debt except in strict accordance with some
provision to that effect in his contract. Here is a debtor who
would have been bound to pay the full amount immediately
if there had been no special provision to the contrary. Any
such provision as there may be is a kind of grace to him
and it is not to be extended beyond the strict terms in which
it is expressed. He may take 2 per cent. off if he pays at
any time within ten days. When the ten days are passed
the contract stands precisely as if it had said nothing at
all about discount for payment within ten days. This debtor
had no right to deduct the 2 per cent. He is trying to take
an advantage which his contract does not give him. If he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>were asked to point out a clause in the contract giving him
a right to take off the discount later than the tenth day,
of course, he could not do it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Question.—If a shipper sells a carload of lumber f. o. b. shipping
point with draft attached to bill of lading and bills the car
to his own order, notify the purchaser, and if the car should be
wrecked in transit or should never reach its proper destination,
would the buyer who bought the car f. o. b. be compelled to pay
the draft and take up the bill of lading and seek recourse against
the carriers? Should the shipper bill a car to the order of a bank,
notify the f. o. b. purchaser and sell the draft and bill of lading
to the bank outright, would the purchaser be compelled to pay for
same?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: When a sale is made f. o. b. shipping point the
seller can make a valid delivery at that point. If he delivers
the goods to a carrier there, takes a bill of lading making
them deliverable to the buyer and forwards it to the latter,
his full duty is done and the goods are at that moment, in
legal effect, delivered to the buyer; they are actually delivered
to the buyer’s agent, the carrier, and that is equivalent
to a delivery to the buyer himself. This is the kind of delivery
the seller is at liberty to make, under the contract, but
he may not do so. He might, conceivably, carry the goods
in his own arms to the buyer, or he may deliver them to one
who is unquestionably his own agent. In either of these
cases delivery to the buyer does not occur until the goods
reach their destination. If A ships goods to the place in
which B resides and takes the bill of lading to his own order
the goods are not in any sense delivered to B or to his agent.
They are A’s goods. He can stop them where he will and
take them back into his own possession. When they reach
their destination he can take charge of them or have them
delivered to anyone he may choose to name. Those goods
could be seized by a creditor of the seller and they could
not be seized by a creditor of the buyer. If they are lost
in transit it is the seller’s loss. A seller must either deliver
the goods or retain them. He cannot do both. He cannot
deliver them so as to make the buyer liable in case of loss
and still retain them so that they will be his, to do with as
he will if there is no loss. The same result follows if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>bill of lading is sold to a bank. A bill of lading represents
goods in transit and transfer of the bill transfers the goods.
The direction to the carrier to “notify” one person or another
is of no importance. Goods may be consigned to B
and the carrier, for one reason or another or for no reason
at all, may be directed to “notify” X or Y or Z of the fact
that they have arrived. Notification is not to be substituted
for delivery.</p>

which would lead A to question the credit of B, such as his taking
a contract at a loss (this occurring since the contracts were made)
can A demand payment before delivery of the goods, although
the contract specifies 30 days from certain dates? Can A cancel
the two uncompleted contracts for any of the above reasons, viz.,
non-fulfillment of the condition of the first contract by B or doubt
as to B’s credit? If cancelled by A would B have any legal redress
such as buying the quantity and grade of material stipulated by
the contracts in the open market and compelling A to pay the difference
in price should the present market price be higher than the
prices stipulated in the contracts?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: When a man buys goods on credit it is always
an implied condition of the contract that he shall “keep his
credit good,” as the courts phrase it, till the time of delivery
arrives. If he becomes insolvent before that time he cannot
demand that the seller shall ship the goods. If the seller
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>does ship them, and then learns of the insolvency, he may
stop the goods before they reach the buyer and take them
back into his own possession. A buyer on credit has no
right to demand that the goods shall be delivered to him at
a time when he is insolvent and when there is reason to
believe, accordingly, that the goods may have to be sold to
pay his other debts. That is the situation in the case our
correspondent puts, and the seller is certainly not bound to
deliver the merchandise. By insolvency, in a case of this
kind, is not meant an actual assignment for creditors; neither
does it mean that the buyer has gone into bankruptcy or
made any other public acknowledgment of the fact that he
is insolvent. It means that he has become unable to pay his
debts as they fall due. The seller must be able to show that
at least one debt has fallen due against the buyer and that
he has not paid it promptly. Of course, it must be a debt
the validity of which the buyer himself does not dispute upon
any tenable or reasonable ground. The buyer in this case
has failed to pay such a debt. The seller has ample proof
of the fact because the debt was owing to him. The buyer
has not “kept his credit good,” and he has no right to
demand that goods sold to him on credit shall be delivered.
If they are not delivered he will have no legal ground of
complaint or cause of action against the seller. It is not the
seller who is guilty of a breach of contract, but the buyer;
he is guilty of a breach of the implied condition which enters
into all such contracts—the condition that the buyer shall
“keep his credit good.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Question.—We sent an inquiry for certain sizes of lumber to
a mill asking for quotations. Our inquiry was delayed in the mails,
and, as it did not reach the mill in time enough to quote we placed
the order with the mill, but did not specify prices. The mill
acknowledged our order, saying, “We have entered your order as
per enclosed carbon,” and after each item they named a price. The
lumber was shipped and an invoice sent us, but on two of the
items a larger amount is charged than specified in the communication
from the mill, saying our order had been entered. In remitting
we deducted the difference between the prices mentioned in reply
from the mill and the invoice, but the mill claims they made a
clerical error and that we are bound to pay the invoice price. What
is our position in the matter?</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Reply: When a seller puts a price on his goods and the
buyer accepts them at that price it is then too late for the
seller to demand more except in the following case: If the
buyer knew that a mistake had been made, or if the mistake
was so gross and palpable that he ought to have known
it to be a mistake, then it may be corrected. If a seller were
to quote $1.25 when all buyers knew that $12.50 was about
the market price, the buyer would not be allowed to claim
the goods at the quotation without making special inquiry as
to its accuracy; if the quotation was only slightly under the
market, so that no suspicion attached to it, and if there was
nothing else to show that a mistake had been made, and if
the buyer had no actual knowledge of the fact, the seller
is bound. Taking the whole class of sellers together, it
would not be a safe rule to allow them to come around and
collect more after a sale had been made and concluded upon
the plea that they had not asked as much as they intended
to ask.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>A CARRIER SHOULD PAY VALUE AT DESTINATION FOR LUMBER LOST.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Question.—On what basis must a railroad company settle a
claim by a consignee on lumber damaged or lost? Must the consignee
supply the original invoices, or is he entitled to the selling
price in his market?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: If the contract does not provide otherwise, a
carrier who fails to deliver goods must, as a rule, pay to the
consignee the value of the goods at the time and place at
which delivery should have been made. The carrier is to
retain his freight charges out of this amount, of course, if
freight has not been paid in advance. This is the only rule
by which the whole of the loss can be placed upon the carrier,
where it belongs. If he had done his duty and delivered
the goods the consignee could have sold them at the prices
there and then prevailing. If the carrier pays the consignee
less than this amount the consignee himself must bear part of
the burden of the carrier’s negligence. Of course, if the
contract provides that settlement shall be upon some other
basis, original cost, for example, the contract will be enforced.
The only other exception to the rule is that which arises when
the goods have already been sold for an amount which is
not so great as the market price at the place and time at
which delivery ought to have been made. If delivery had
been duly made, in such a case the owner of the goods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>could not have taken advantage of ruling market prices; he
had already bound himself to deliver the goods at a price
which proves to be less than the market on the day fixed for
delivery, and this selling price is all that he can claim. The
object in every case, except where there has been a special
contract of carriage, is to place the owner of the goods as
nearly as possible in the same position he would have occupied
if the carrier had done his duty and to put upon the
carrier, where it belongs, the whole burden of his negligence
and breach of contract.</p>

shipped within the specified time but did not reach destination as
promptly as it should, and our customer claims that he has been
damaged to such an extent that he refuses to take in the car, saying
it arrived too late for his use. The lumber is exactly in accordance
with the order and is a special worked car. We will be put
to some expense in disposing of this elsewhere and will probably
have to sell it at a lower price. What method should we pursue?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: There are three courses:</p>

<p class='c013'>First: The shipper may store the lumber for the buyer
and sue him for the invoice price.</p>

<p class='c013'>Second: He may retain the property as his own and
recover the difference between the market price at the time
and place of delivery and the contract price.</p>

<p class='c013'>Third: He may sell the lumber, acting as the agent for
the purchaser and recover the difference between the contract
and the price of resale.</p>

<p class='c013'>This last course is usually considered best because it
gives the seller the use of the money realized on the resale.
Of course in reselling the lumber care must be taken to
obtain the best possible price, and in the event of the resale
the seller is entitled to recovery from the purchaser of all the
costs which he was obliged to lay out in bringing to pass a

<p class='c008'>Question.—A makes a shipment to a customer in another State
and several days after he receives information that leads him to
believe it prudent to hold up the shipment and have the goods
reconsigned to himself. He immediately takes the matter up with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>the initial carriers with the request that they take immediate steps
to stop the shipment in transit and have same reconsigned to himself,
all charges to follow. In the event that the initial carrier fails
to take prompt action and it develops that the goods are delivered
after the initial carrier has been notified not to deliver them, thereby
causing A the loss of the value of the shipment, cannot A hold the
initial carrier responsible for the value of the shipment?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: When goods are sold on credit and the buyer
becomes insolvent or gives proof of insolvency, before the
goods are delivered to him, it is the right of the seller to
take them back into his own possession and refuse delivery
altogether; this is because one who buys on credit is bound
by an implied contract that he will keep his credit good and
be able to pay for the goods when the due date arrives.
When the carrier is called upon to return the goods to the
seller he must act at his own peril. If he does return them
and the buyer was not insolvent, the carrier must answer to
the buyer for his damages. On the other hand, if the carrier
fails to return the goods and the seller can show that the
buyer was insolvent the carrier must respond to the seller for
the value of the goods or for such part of it as the seller
finally loses. The seller, in the case under consideration,
must first establish the fact that he had a right, within these
rules, to stop the goods. Then if he can show also that this
might have been done except for negligence or delay on the
part of the initial carrier, he can hold that carrier liable for
his loss.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frequently inquiries are sent us inquiring as to the advisability
of accepting checks marked “In full settlement of account to date,”
etc. The situation is not the same in all States but usually the
questions are covered in the doctrine of accord and satisfaction
explained as follows:</p>

<p class='c011'>If an account between two parties be actively and openly in
dispute and the debtor sends to his creditor a remittance for a
specific sum and states that such sum is offered in full settlement,
and if such sum be accepted by the creditor he is bound thereby and
cannot thereafter recover anything on the account from his debtor.
The mere sending of a remittance, however, for an amount less
than the amount due, where there is no dispute between the parties,
does not affect the right of the creditor to bring suit for the
balance due even though it is stated in the letter accompanying the
remittance that said remittance is in full settlement.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>The question as to whether a dispute is open or active can
usually be easily determined. If the seller and buyer have been in
correspondence regarding a dispute, that determines its activity,

  <h2 class='c004'>ACCEPTANCE IN NEW JERSEY MAY BE AFFECTED BY STATUTE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Our attention has been called to a law passed by the New Jersey
Legislature in 1907, from which the following is quoted:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where the seller delivers to the buyer the goods he contracted
to sell mixed with goods of a different description not included in
the contract, the buyer may accept the goods which are in accordance
with the contract and reject the rest, or he may reject the
whole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>We are receiving inquiries as to the responsibility of a customer
where he had used part of a shipment of lumber of one description,
the customer claiming the statute above quoted permitted him to
use such of the shipment as was up to grade and reject the balance.
Commenting on the law above referred to where a shipment contains
lumber under one description it would seem to be the law
that if the consignor delivers to the consignee the goods contracted
for of the same description included in the contract, the debtor,
with his right of inspection must either reject or accept, and if the
consignee does any act by which it could be inferred that he is exercising
the right of ownership of any part of the merchandise so
shipped and delivered, we believe he is liable for the entire amount
of lumber shipped and received. He cannot take out what he wants
of the order and reject the balance.</p>

<p class='c011'>The New Jersey law covers mixed shipments, for instance, in
a shipment of barn boards, siding and moulding, the buyer would
have the right to accept either of these items without prejudicing
his claim, or waiving his privilege of rejection on the other two,
but where a straight car of barn boards is ordered the buyer is not
privileged to use a portion of them and reject the balance as not
being up to contract.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CONDITIONAL CLAUSES REGARDING TERMS ON LETTERHEADS, INVOICES, ETC.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It seems again necessary to call the attention of our members
to the custom of printing a clause on the top of letter-heads used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>for quotation to the effect that agreements or contracts are contingent
upon strikes, accident, other causes, etc. It frequently happens
that this clause is so printed on the letter-head or quotation
form as not to make it a part of the contract, and the following
attorney’s opinion is pertinent:</p>

<p class='c011'>When a man has a proposal to make to another in writing he
begins, usually and naturally, with the name of the place from
which he writes and the date. Then he makes his proposal and
closes by signing his name. The paper upon which he writes may
have printed at the top or somewhere in the margin the name and
address of the firm; the telephone number and the number of the
firm’s post office box; the cable address; a list of five or six cable
codes used by the concern; names of the various articles in which
it deals; facsimiles of some of its trade-marks; pictures of certain
gold medals that have been awarded to its goods at fairs of one
sort or another. Frequently there is much other matter. There
may also be something to the effect that agreements are contingent
upon strikes. Of course, the person to whom the proposition is
addressed is not concerned with any of these things. What he has
to read and consider is the matter found between the address and
the signature, and nothing more. That is the reasonable interpretation
of the matter, and, is, very naturally, the view that the courts
have taken of it. In 153 Ill., 102, to quote only one case, the
Supreme Court of Illinois decided that “the words ‘all sales subject
to strikes and accidents,’ printed as part of the letter-head of a
reply, do not form any part of the contract.” No court could very
well reach any other conclusion, so far as we can ascertain, and no
court has done so.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the same manner a postscript on a letter or quotation blank
is not an actual part of the contract unless it is signed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Other members have also attempted to enforce terms printed
on their invoices where such terms were not referred to in the
original order or contract of sale. The following opinion will be
helpful in such matters:</p>

<p class='c011'>The question of the invoice may be settled with little difficulty.
Nothing upon the invoice is binding upon the buyer, whether it
is written or printed and whether it stands in the body of the document
or in the margin. A contract is made by two persons, and
it is binding only in so far as both have agreed to be bound by it.
An invoice is made, after all the terms of the contract have been
irrevocably fixed, and it is made by only one person. The seller
would have things very much his own way if he could go off alone,
after a contract had been made, and alter or amend or limit or explain
it by his own act. He has no such power, of course, and he
cannot put anything upon his invoice in writing or in print, that
will bind the buyer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frequently our members ask what constitutes shipment within a
reasonable time, or what is the meaning of “due notice,” etc.</p>

<p class='c011'>The courts are always careful not to give any general definition
of such words as “due,” “reasonable” and the like. What is
due or reasonable notice in one case might not be so in another; and
each case is made to stand on its own facts. “Due notice,” in one
case or in any other, is such notice as, all of the circumstances and
conditions being duly considered, would permit the person receiving
the notice to do that which was required of him. Evidence is
to be presented, on the one side, and on the other, to show whether
due notice, within this definition, was or was not given. Due notice
is sufficient notice, and that which is sufficient in one case may be
too much or too little in another.</p>

He offers to pay for what he has already had, but he says we cannot

<p class='c013'>Reply: This buyer can be held for the value of the six
cars. A written contract or memorandum is not necessary
where part of the goods have been delivered and accepted.
There are three ways in which a sale of goods for $50 or
more may be made valid and binding: (1) By a written
contract or memorandum; (2) by delivery and acceptance of
part of the goods; (3) by payment of part of the purchase
price. Thus a buyer sometimes pays a small part of the

<p class='c008'>Question.—We took an order from a customer for ten cars of
lumber to be shipped one car every two weeks. The first three cars
were shipped on time, but there was a lapse of four weeks before
the fourth car got out and weather at the mill delayed our getting
the balance out as per agreement, although we finally got off all
the cars. When the delayed shipments began to arrive our customer
complained of the delay, and said he would charge us back
with any cost he had to allow his customer. We objected, but
our customer said we agreed to time deliveries, and would hold us
to same. He took in all the shipments, but now wants to charge
us with a loss he claimed he allowed his customer.</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: If the lumber was offered to the buyer at a time
later than any date agreed upon at time of sale, the buyer
could have refused to accept it, and would have had a claim
against the seller for damages occasioned by the delay. On
the other hand, the buyer might accept the goods, notwithstanding
the delay, if he chose to do so. He had no option
except one of these two, accept the goods and pay for them,
or reject them as not having been sent in time to constitute
a fulfillment of his order. He could not accept the goods at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>any other than the contract price. This is the situation in
which the case would have stood if there had been no correspondence
between the ordering of the goods and their shipment.
It is barely possible that the correspondence may contain
some modification of the original contract, introduced
into it by mutual consent, which would give the buyer the
right he now claims. If the original contract was allowed to
stand as made then the buyer has mistaken his remedy if
he had any remedy at all. The goods were offered in fulfillment
of the contract. He could accept them as such, or
reject them. Having rejected them, it is possible that he
would have had a claim against the seller for failure to
deliver the goods in time. This much, however, is perfectly
well settled. The buyer had no right to the goods at all
except in fulfillment of his contract. If he accepts them, the
contract is fulfilled and he cannot turn about and demand
damages because it is not so. If he thinks the delivery is not
a good one, because of delay, let him refuse it and then
say that the contract has not been carried out. It has been
or it has not been, and his acceptance of the goods shows
that it has been.</p>

a carload of lumber at a price based on delivery f. o. b. New York
City. The material is offered to B on a lighter at the agreed upon
point of destination, and B, on inspecting it, comes to the conclusion
that it is not what he ordered, and refuses to accept it, simply telling
the railroad that the material is not what he ordered, and
refuses to unload. B does not notify the shipper, A, and the latter
knows nothing of B’s rejection or refusal to accept until about a
month later, when he receives a notice from the railroad that B
has rejected the material. A claims that B should have notified
him immediately by mail or telegram that the material was not
what he ordered, but B claims that he was not compelled to do
so and that the fact that the railroad did not notify A until a month
after was no concern of his. Is he right?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: There is no rule of law known to us which would
have required the buyer to notify the seller of his determination
not to accept the goods in this case. If the buyer had
taken the goods from the carrier he would have been bound
to notify the seller of this subsequent rejection. If delivery
had been made at the shipping point instead of f. o. b. destination,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>so that the carrier should have been agent of the
buyer and not of the seller, the buyer’s duty to give notice
would have been the same. As the case actually stands it is
this: The seller himself or his agent, which amounts to the
same thing, tenders the goods to the buyer and the buyer
rejects them without having taken them into his custody.
The seller or his agent immediately knows that they are rejected.
How could notice add anything to that knowledge?
If it is the seller’s agent who knows, and if the seller himself
does not know, that is because the seller has not given
proper instructions to his agent or because the agent has
failed to follow them if they were given. In neither case is
the buyer to blame. He has notified the seller’s agent that
the goods are refused; that is all he can be required to do.
If the refusal is not justified the seller has his remedy, of
course. If it was justified the seller has sufficient notice
of it. Our correspondent says the seller complains because
the buyer did not notify him “immediately by mail or telegram
that the material was not what he ordered.” That is
absurd in any case. The seller knew as well as the buyer,
and knew before the buyer did whether the goods sent were
such as the buyer had ordered or not. Why should he
be notified of a fact that he knew already.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inquiries are frequently made at this office as to the amount of
tax which a foreign corporation must pay in States where a certificate
is issued to such foreign corporations, authorizing them to do
business under the State statutes. In computing the assessment or
tax the State auditor gets his information from the reports which
ought to be filed annually. The amount of tax assessed is predicated
upon the amount of capital actually employed within the State,
and if no capital is employed, no tax can be legally levied.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>A PRIVATE CUSTOM MAY BE ESTABLISHED TO SUPERSEDE A GENERAL CUSTOM.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c015'>It seems to be a generally accepted custom in the lumber trade
that using a shipment of lumber, even though there be a dispute
regarding the grade, constitutes an acceptance of the shipment as
invoiced unless the shipper has authorized the purchaser to use a
part or all of the lumber in dispute. Our Legal Department has received
some claims for members on disputed shipments where, from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>an examination of the correspondence, it appeared the member had
a valid claim for the full amount of the invoice. After negotiations
with the buyers it developed that in past transactions allowances
were made on several shipments where the grade was in dispute,
after the lumber had been used. We have had occasion to go into
such matters with our attorneys and the latter are of the opinion
that where a sufficient number of adjustments have been made
on such a basis, practically acquiescing in the buyers using a part
of the lumber, would prejudice a claim on a subsequent shipment
where the shipper attempted to take advantage of his right of recovery.
Frequently disputed claims of this character are small and
have to be tried before a local jury and our attorneys have stated
that the custom of having made allowances in the past after lumber
was used would have some bearing with a jury on a subsequent
deal, and possibly be construed by the court as a private custom
apart from the general trade custom.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>AN ORDER MAY BE CANCELED ONLY WHEN BUYER BECOMES INSOLVENT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Question.—A buyer places an order with a mill for five cars of
lumber, deliveries to be one car a month. At the time of the purchase
the buyer is in good financial standing and signed copies of the
contract are exchanged between the buyer and seller. After three
deliveries have been made information reaches the seller that the
financial standing of the buyer has changed for the worse; that is,
he has committed no act of bankruptcy, but a commercial agency
has reduced his capital and credit rating. The seller requests the
buyer to anticipate the payment of some of the previous shipments
before he will agree to make further shipments. The buyer refuses
to comply with this request and asks for the delivery of the balance.
The seller thereupon makes no further deliveries, but when the bills
for the goods delivered become due, demands payment. The buyer
refuses on the ground that the seller has not carried out his part of
the contract. On these facts please tell us what the law in this case
would be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: One who has sold goods on credit is not justified
in refusing delivery simply because the buyer’s financial
standing changes for the worse between the time of sale and
the time of delivery. In the case here put, for example, there
is nothing to show that the buyer is not now amply able to
pay for the goods, or that the contract would have been
declined by the seller if the buyer’s rating at the time had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>what it is now. The seller is entitled to refuse delivery only
if the buyer, before delivery is made, commits any act of
insolvency. He need not become a bankrupt or make an
assignment for creditors. He is insolvent, within the meaning
of this rule, if he fails to pay any just and admittedly
proper debt promptly upon its due date. As long as he is
paying his bills whenever they fall due the seller has no
ground upon which to declare that he is not “keeping his
credit good,” if the buyer in this case is not solvent, as the
word is here defined, the seller need not continue the deliveries.
If the buyer is solvent the seller is not justified in his
position. In that case the buyer need not pay for the goods
already delivered until the time named in the contract for
payment arrives, and he has a valid claim for damages arising
out of the seller’s failure to make the other deliveries in
strict accordance with the contract.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>A BUYER HAS A CLAIM WHEN HE ACCEPTS A DRAFT ON INFERIOR LUMBER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Question.—We bought a car of lumber through a broker. Terms
were: Sight draft with bill of lading attached for three-fourths of
the amount of the invoice, the balance to be paid on arrival and
inspection. We accepted the draft on presentation and when the car
arrived we instructed our truckmen to draw the lumber in. Upon
examination we found that it was all more or less below grade.
We wired shippers accordingly and asked for instructions. We also
wrote them a letter to the above effect and told them that we could
not use the lumber and that we would hold it for their instructions.
Do we need to keep the shipment? Can we compel sellers to return
us the amount of the draft and freight charges?</p>

<p class='c013'>Reply: The buyers are not bound to accept any lumber
not in accordance with the order. They have a valid claim
against the sellers for the amount already paid towards the
purchase of the goods, for the amount expended for freight
and for any other useless expense to which the buyers were
put as a result of the sellers’ failure to do their contract
duty. The buyers also have a claim for damages, if any,
caused by the breach of contract on the part of the sellers.
The latter were bound to supply lumber regularly sold and
accepted by the trade under the terms covering the grade in
question, and their failure so to do was an actionable breach
of contract.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>It occasionally happens that a purchaser of a car of lumber
refuses to accept same and leaves it at the mercy of the railroad company
or common carrier. In this way demurrage piles up and other
loss may arise and the shipper hesitating, for fear of compromising
himself, refuses to do anything with the lumber on his part. This
is generally a mistake because it is the duty of the shipper to make
the loss, if any, as small as possible and it is always safe to first
notify the vendee, who has refused to receive the goods that he, the
shipper, will endeavor to dispose of them in the best possible manner
and hold the vendee responsible for any loss or damage thereby.
In this case he may have to have the goods sold elsewhere or
returned to him, and it is always advisable to endeavor to have
them inspected by two or three competent parties in order to establish
the market value and to ascertain that the defects, if any,
claimed by the vendee, do not exist.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>ACCORD AND SATISFACTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>If a buyer of lumber, disputing the quantity or quality, sends a
check for an amount less than the invoice to the seller, does the
seller in accepting the same preclude himself from recovering the
balance of the account? This situation occurs, we believe, often in
lumber circles and very frequently the remittance is accompanied by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>a letter or some notice written on the check to the effect that it is
sent as a settlement in full and some go so far as to add that if
accepted by the creditor it must be at his peril so far as the remainder
of the invoice or account is concerned. The law on this point is
generally similar to that of the State of New York wherein it is well
settled that the acceptance or use of such a remittance does not stop
or prevent the creditor from recovering the balance of the debt
from its debtor unless there has been an honest dispute as to the
amount of indebtedness or the existence of any indebtedness at all.
This is what is termed an unliquidated account or claim and in such
a case, when one tenders an amount to be accepted in full or rejected
and the other accepts the remittance, it is a complete accord and
satisfaction. The rule is different when the amount or debt is certain
and there is only a dispute between the parties concerning
questions of shortage, quality, etc. This is what is termed a liquidated
claim and the acceptance of a remittance to be a full settlement
does not preclude the creditor from using the remittance, crediting
the same to the account of the debtor and suing for the balance.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CANCELLING AN ORDER BEFORE SHIPMENT—EFFECT OF SAME.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Many lumbermen take orders from their customers through
traveling men or other representatives. Usually the orders are written
down in a manifold book and often are signed by the buyer.
The order is usually taken subject to confirmation by the house or
home office. This acceptance or confirmation is customarily made
by acknowledgement of the order in writing to the purchaser. The
question in point is whether or not, if an agent has taken an order
as above, can the purchaser cancel the order and his obligation to
accept the lumber? In a case in this State a purchaser of merchandise
placed the order with the traveling man and later wrote to the
house cancelling the same, as he found he could buy similar goods
for less money. The purchaser wrote before the seller had communicated
any acceptance or intention to fill the order which had
been given to the seller’s representative. Some correspondence
ensued in which the seller refused to cancel the order and later
shipped the goods to the purchaser, who refused to receive them.
The action resulted in a judgment in favor of the seller, which was
reversed on appeal, in which numerous authorities were cited by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Appellate Court holding substantially as follows—“An order or
request in writing, addressed to a dealer or his agent to ship to the
writer on or before a date named, goods of a kind specified, for
which the writer agreed to pay a price named, does not constitute a
contract until accepted or acted upon by the vendor and may be
withdrawn at any time before acceptance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is obvious that the result would be different were the vendor
to have signified his acceptance of the order prior to the cancelling
or withdrawal of same by the purchaser, as we would then have a
valid contract, which could not be cancelled without mutual agreement.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this connection it might be well to add that in business transacted
by mail, the general rule is that the time of the mailing or
depositing in the mail of a letter is the presumptive time of the communicating
of the facts therein to the party to whom the letter is
addressed, hence when an order is sent by mail, another letter withdrawing
the order, if mailed prior to the mailing of the acceptance
by the other party, is a complete cancellation of the order in the
first letter. In other words, the law does not take into account the
periods elapsing by reason of the means of communication but only
the acts of the parties in so far as the time of such acts is considered
to have taken place.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>DISCHARGE IN BANKRUPTCY—WHAT WILL PREVENT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Under the amendment to the National Bankruptcy Law as
amended in February, 1903, the rules relating to discharge of bankrupts,
are somewhat changed. Many parties are interested ofttimes
in preventing the discharge of a bankrupt for no other reason than
that they are creditors who believe that the bankrupt has not been
honest in his dealings and irrespective of motives of personal enmity
feel that the welfare of the business community is served by preventing
the bankrupt from being discharged and re-entering into
business. Probably the act that will prevent a discharge that most
often appeals to the creditor is that the bankrupt obtained goods on
a false statement in writing. This, if shown, will prevent the discharge,
the law reading in this respect, as follows: “Obtained
property on credit from any person upon materially false statement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>in writing made to such person for the purpose of obtaining such
property on credit.” It is obvious that the party who urges this
objection must be the one who has been injured thereby.</p>

<p class='c009'>Other debts not dischargeable in bankruptcy are taxes levied by
the United States, the State, county, district or municipality in
which bankrupt resides, and others of no practical interest to merchants.
In addition to the above are those debts which have not been
duly scheduled by the bankrupt in the proceeding in time for proof
and allowance, with the name of the creditor if known to the bankrupt,
unless such creditor had notice or actual knowledge of the
proceedings in bankruptcy; or were created by his fraud, embezzlement,
misappropriation, or defalcation, while acting as an officer or
in any fiduciary capacity.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>A purchaser of a quantity of merchandise ordered by letter two
hundred to three hundred tons of a certain article to be delivered
within the following six months as wanted. The vendor duly
acknowledged receipt of the order and accepted same, stating that
they would deliver a certain quantity in the immediate future and
balance as ordered within the following six months. Thereafter,
the vendor delivered a certain portion of the merchandise for which
it was paid with the exception of one installment, which the vendee
refused to pay for alleging that the vendor had refused to deliver
further installments. The purchaser sued the vendor for damages
for breach of contract in failing to deliver the balance of the contract.
The Court held that by the terms of the order the vendor
could not insist on the purchaser taking more than the two hundred
tons but the purchaser on his part could insist within the six months
period upon the vendor delivering the remaining hundred tons, it
appearing that two hundred tons had been already delivered. In
fact, it was an option which the vendee could enforce but not the
vendor.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>That it is the legal obligation of a bank, which receives a note for
collection to use all diligence to give notice of its dishonor to all
endorsers is set forth in a decision of the Appellate Division of the
New York Supreme Court (Howard vs. Bank of Metropolis, 95
App. Div. 342).</p>

<p class='c009'>One H., who was the owner of a promissory note made by one S.,
and indorsed by G., delivered the note to a bank for collection and
left with it a card giving G.’s full name and address, stating that he
wished the note carefully protested as he expected to hold the
endorser, the maker not being responsible, and that he would not
be in the city when the note fell due. The maker of the note having
failed to pay it when due, the bank sent it to its Notary for protest,
but failed to deliver to the Notary the card bearing the name and
address of the endorser, and informed the Notary that the endorser’s
address was unknown. The Notary made out two notices of protest,
one directed to H. and the other to G. Both notices were placed
in an envelope and sent to H., who did not receive them, being out
of town.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Court held the bank responsible and in rendering its opinion
referred to a prior New York case entitled First National Bank
vs. Fourth National Bank (77 N. Y. 320) and quoted “it is the duty
of an agent who receives negotiable paper for collection, in case such
paper is not paid, so to act as to secure and preserve the liability
thereon of all the parties prior to his principal, and if he fails in this
duty and thereby causes loss to his principal, he becomes liable for

  <h2 class='c004'>ACCOUNTS STATED.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Settlement of Accounts and Striking of a Balance Between
Parties—What It Consists Of.</p>

<p class='c009'>Upon merchandise accounts which embrace many items or cover
transactions running through a long period it is often wise to
strike a balance or to bring about an agreement between the creditor
and debtor as to the exact amount owing thereon. The value of such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>arrangement becomes of great moment when at a later date attempt
is made to enforce collection of the account. It obviates the necessity
proving various material matters such as the delivery of the
various items charged to the debtor; that they were accepted by the
debtor; that they were of the kind called for by the contract of sale;
that there was a full number or count; that the agreed prices were as
charged. The fixing of a balance upon a running account is legally
known as the <i>stating of an account</i> and an account so fixed is an
“account stated.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A running account becomes an “account stated” by agreement
either express, or implied by acquiesence, between the parties, that
a definite amount or sum is owing from one to the other. No particular
form of words is essential and neither must it be in writing,
although a written expression is of more ready proof and, therefore,
preferable. An express admission, either verbally or by letter,
of the correctness of an account constitutes an account stated.—(Vernon
v. Simmons, 7 N. Y. Supp. 649.)</p>

<p class='c009'>In the above case the debtor retained accounts received from his
creditor without objection or replying and subsequently acknowledged
orally the receipt of the letter containing them and promising
to pay later on, and it was held that the creditor could sue upon an
account stated. It is not necessary that the account should be
signed by the parties to make it an account stated. It is enough
that it has been examined and accepted by the party and this acceptance
need not be expressed; it may be implied from circumstances
such as keeping it without objection beyond a reasonable time. As
to what is an unreasonable time depends on circumstances largely
and it has been held that two months was sufficient, although generally
a longer time would be more conclusive. This acquiesence,
however, may be explained by the debtor, which would nullify the
apparent acceptance, but without such satisfactory explanation the
situation is prima facie against him. Where the indebtedness has
been expressly denied, the retention of the account does not bind the
debtor.—(Austin v. Wilson, 11 N. Y. Supp. 565.)</p>

<p class='c009'>In bringing an action on an account stated if the plaintiff is
defeated through failure to prove the agreement as to the amount
or the fact that an “account was stated;” he would not be debarred
from bringing another action to recover for the various items comprising
the account.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>ACCEPTANCE OF GOODS—WHEN SUFFICIENT TO BIND PURCHASER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'> It is a daily occurrence in the lumber trade that a purchaser
finds some objection to the quality or quantity of lumber shipped to
him on order. Frequently in such case, without any communication
with the shipper a purchaser feels warranted in using such portion
of the lumber as suits him, relying on an assumed right to lay aside
the balance for the account of the shipper, with the idea that he
may reject it entirely or obtain some reduction in the price. The
general rule laid down by the courts in cases of this sort is as follows:
Where the vendee of goods, purchased without warranty,
after full opportunity for an inspection, accepts them without objection
when delivered, he cannot, in an action against him to recover
the price defend upon the ground that they did not conform to the
contract of sale.—(Smith vs. Coe, 170 N. Y. 162.)</p>

<p class='c009'>If the purchaser, upon the receipt of the goods, makes objection
to the quality, but, without the express permission of the seller,
uses a portion, it is held that by so doing he tacitly waives his objection
and his acts amount to an acceptance of the entire lot.—(Coplay
Iron Co. vs. Pope, 108 N. Y. Appeals, 232.)</p>

<p class='c009'>In the above case, which involved a transaction in pig iron, the
purchaser complained of the shipment and upon being sued for the
purchase price set up a claim for damages by reason of the alleged
defective quality and it was held “where after discovery or opportunity
to discover any defect in goods delivered under an executory
contract of sale, the vendee neither returns or offers to return the
property nor gives the vendor notice or opportunity to take it back,
in the absence of a collateral warranty or agreement as to quality,
he is conclusively presumed to have acquiesced and may not thereafter
complain of the inferior quality.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When a car constitutes but a portion of the order, which was in
the nature of one contract for a number of cars, the purchaser cannot
object to the quality and retain the initial car and decline to
receive the balance of the shipment. The contract of sale being an
indivisible one in law, the purchaser by his acceptance of the initial
shipment and failure to return it, is conclusively presumed to have
acquiesced in the quality of the lumber offered him and waived any
objection to the remainder of the shipment order provided it is the
same as the first car.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>In the case of Weil vs. The Unique Electric Device Co., Reported
in 39 Misc. (New York 1902), page 527, a vendor sought to recover
the stipulated purchase price of certain merchandise sold to the
defendant, consisting of some 3,000 electric batteries, of which 1,000
were delivered and paid for, but the purchaser refused to accept the
balance on the ground that the quality was not according to the
agreement. The court held that the contract of sale was an entire
one and it was the duty of the purchaser to receive balance of the
order, provided they were of similar quality to the lot already delivered.
That when the purchaser received the first lot and found them
unsatisfactory, it was its duty to rescind the sale and return, or offer
to return the goods; and its failure so to do was an acquiesence on
its part of the quality of the goods in question.</p>

<p class='c009'>The above discussion leaves for further consideration the question
when a purchaser though bound to take goods and chargeable
with their full price, may hold the seller liable for damages for
breach of express or implicit warranty.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is the custom of many merchants, with a view doubtless of
securing the best possible terms and yet to leave a loophole, whereby
they can take only such an amount as they desire, to give the vendor
a general idea of their requirements.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Heisel vs. Volkman, reported in Volume 55, New York
Appellate Division, page 607, a dealer wrote to a manufacturer of
certain kinds of merchandise asking for “prices for supplying our
requirements,” stating “we estimate our yearly requirements at from
five to ten million pieces. Are confident that they will not be less
than the smaller amount and reasonably certain that they will come
up to or exceed the larger one,” to which the manufacturer replied,
“I would be willing to make a yearly contract with you from five to
ten million pieces, etc.” The purchaser did not take the minimum
amount of five million pieces during the period in question and the
manufacturer sued to recover the purchase price of the difference,
having, of course, done what was necessary in respect to making a
tender of delivery. The court held that the purchaser was obligated
to take and pay for at least five million pieces, even if his
requirements for the year fell substantially short of that amount
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>and that the seller in making his price had a right to rely upon the
minimum amount stated by the buyer.</p>

<p class='c009'>Attention is called to this for the reason that the same rule
would apply to a transaction in lumber and because many of the
trade are in the habit of making contracts upon similar conditions
and referring in elastic terms to their probable requirements.</p>

conditions, reclaim the goods. This is so even if the carrier is one
designated or selected by the purchaser. A fraudulent sale of the
goods by the purchaser to third parties will not defeat the right of

association, which certificate with a copy of the charter must
be filed with and the certificate recorded by, the Clerk of the
County Court of such county in which their business is conducted.
A foreign corporation obtaining the above mentioned
certificate authorizing to hold property and do business in
West Virginia has the powers, rights and privileges and is
subject to the same regulations, restrictions and liabilities that
are conferred by statutes of West Virginia on domestic
corporations.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every foreign corporation which shall do business in the
State without having obtained such certificate and having it
filed and recorded according to law shall be guilty of misdemeanor,
and upon conviction shall be fined not less than $50,
nor more than $1,000 for each month its failure so to comply
shall continue.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Indiana.</span>—Every foreign corporation, except railroad and
telegraph companies, built before March 15, 1901, and insurance
companies must maintain a public business office in
Indiana and must designate a representative in Indiana on
whom service of process may be had. Such foreign corporations
are subject to the liabilities, restrictions and duties
imposed upon domestic corporations. They must before being
permitted to do business in Indiana file in the office of the
Secretary of State certified copy of its articles of incorporation,
and a statement sworn to by the principal or agent in
Indiana of the proportion of the capital stock of such corporation
represented by its property located and business
transacted in Indiana, and must pay in the office of the Secretary
of State upon such proportion incorporation fees equal
to those required of domestic corporations. The Secretary of
State shall then issue a certificate authorizing such corporation
to do business. Until this law is complied with, demands
of a foreign corporation, whether arising out of contract or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>tort, cannot be enforced in the courts of Indiana, and such
corporation is subject to a fine of not less than $1,000. Fee
for filing articles of incorporation of a corporation with capital
stock of $10,000 or under is $10, over $10,000, one-tenth
of one per cent. upon authorized capital. No annual State tax
on corporation as such.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Tennessee.</span>—Foreign corporations must file in the office
of the Secretary of State a copy of its charter and cause an
abstract of same to be recorded in the office of the Register of
each county in which such corporation purposes to carry on
its business or to acquire and own property. Penalty for
failure to do so shall subject the offender to a fine of not less
than $100 nor more than $500. They must pay in the office of
the Secretary of State a tax or license of $100 to exercise
such privilege.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Mississippi.</span>—Foreign corporations may sue and be sued
and are liable to be proceeded against by attachment or otherwise,
as individual non-residents are liable. The acts of their
agents shall have the same force as the acts of agents of
private persons within the scope of their power. They cannot
recover on any contract made in the State or cause action
originating therein which is in violation of laws or policies of
States. No general statutes about taxation of foreign corporations.
Subject governed in main by common rule as to
taxes, but they are required to file with the Secretary of State
certified copy of their charter for record, for which a graduated
fee is fixed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Kentucky.</span>—If the corporation be organized under the
laws of another State a board shall fix the value of the capital
stock determined from the amount of the gross receipts of the
corporation in Kentucky and elsewhere the proportion which
the gross receipts in Kentucky bear to the entire gross receipts.
The same proportion of the value of the entire capital stock,
less the assessed value of tangible property in the State, shall
be the correct value of the corporation franchise for taxation.
Reports must be made and failure is a misdemeanor punishable
by a fine of $1,000 and $50 for each day.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Ohio.</span>—Foreign corporations are forbidden to do business
until they have procured from the Secretary of State certificate
that they have complied with the requirements of law
which authorize them to do business in the State, and until
said companies shall have caused the proportion of their
capital stock employed within the State to be determined by
the Secretary of the State, and shall have paid to him a fee of
one-tenth of one per cent. upon such amount and obtained his
certificate of such payment. No foreign corporation doing
business in the State can maintain any action upon any contract
made by it in the State until it has procured such certificate.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>The corporation must file with the Secretary of State
due copy of its charter and statement under seal of the
amount of its stock, the nature of its business and state which
is to be its principal place of business, designating a person
upon whom process against such corporation may be served.
The person so designated must have an office where the corporation
is to have its principal place of business within the
State. Corporations complying with these requirements are
exempt from attachment on the ground that they are foreign
corporations.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Michigan.</span>—Foreign corporations filing in the office
of the Secretary of State certified copy of articles of incorporation
and an appointment of an agent in this State for
service of processes may carry on their business in Michigan.
Foreign corporations may bring suits on furnishing security
for costs.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>New York.</span>—No foreign corporation shall do business
without first procuring from the Secretary of State certificate
that it has complied with requirements of law. License fee
shall be paid. No foreign corporation can do business in New
York or sue on contract made there unless it has procured
such certificate prior to the making of the contract. Selling
goods through a factor within the State is not covered by
this prohibitive clause. Before granting such certificate foreign
corporation must file with Secretary of State copy of its
charter and a statement setting forth its business, its principal
place of business within the State and designating the person
upon whom processes may be served. Such person must
have an office within the State, where the principal place of
business of such corporation is located. Foreign corporations
must pay to State Treasurer a license fee of one-eighth of one
per cent. for privilege of exercising its corporate franchise in
New York, to be computed upon the amount of capital stock
employed within the State during its first year of business.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CONTRACTS FOR CARLOADS SEPARABLE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Where a contract was made for three carloads of a company’s
No. 1 white cedar shingles and the purchaser accepted and paid for
two carloads, but refused to accept the third because of alleged inferior
grade and quality, and because the shingles were not made by
said company, the Supreme Court of Minnesota holds that the contract
as to the three carloads was separable, so that the purchaser’s
payment and the seller’s acceptance of payment for two carloads did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>not prevent the seller from beginning an action to recover the purchase
price of the third carload nor the purchaser from defending
therein. The court also holds that a buyer, seeking to reject an
article as not in accordance with the contract of sale, must do nothing
after he discovers the true condition inconsistent with the seller’s
ownership of the property.—Duluth Log. Co. vs. John C. Hill Co.,
124 N. W., 967.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>WARRANTY SURVIVES ACCEPTANCE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Where one attempting to sell shingles stated in a letter that “They
are mighty good shingles, they are as good as you could get anywhere,”
it was a warranty of their quality. Where a buyer of
shingles accepts shingles which he knows are of a grade inferior to
what the seller warranted, the buyer does not waive the warranty,
and he can defend against an action for the price on that ground.

<p class='c008'>On arrival of a carload of shingles, the buyer complained of their
quality, and for the purpose of securing an immediate settlement and
avoiding further negotiations the seller agreed to accept a less
amount for them than the full price if payment was made before a
specified time. The buyer failed to make payment within such
specified time and in a suit to recover for the full amount of the
invoice it was held by the court that the seller could require payment
under the circumstances of the full price. (Texas Court of Civil

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
